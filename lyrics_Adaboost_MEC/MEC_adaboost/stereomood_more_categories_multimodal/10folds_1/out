A hundred days have made me older . Since the last time that I saw your pretty face . A thousand lies have made me colder. And I don't think I can look at this the same . But all the miles that separate . They disappear now when I'm dreaming of your face . . I'm here without you baby . But you're still on my lonely mind . I think about you baby . And I dream about you all the time . I'm here without you baby . And you're still with me in my dreams . And tonight it's only you and me yeah. . The miles just keep rollin'. As the people leave their way to say hello . I've heard this life is overrated . But I hope that it gets better as we go oh yeah. . I'm here without you baby . But you're still on my lonely mind . I think about you baby . And I dream about you all the time . I'm here without you baby . But you're still with me in my dreams . And tonight girl it's only you and me . . Everything I know . And anywhere I go . It gets hard but it won't take away my love  . And when the last one falls . When it's all said and done . It gets hard but it won't take away my love whoa oh oh. . I'm here without you baby . But you're still on my lonely mind . I think about you baby . And I dream about you all the time . . I'm here without you baby . But you're still with me in my dreams .

Blue textures cascade downward to the base of the monolith. Like brush strokes on a canvas of souls. Two arms reach out a cloak of silent nihil. Revenants untouched by the scythe. They are lost in the dark woods of time. . Aloft in the landscape that you hail. I am the fog that seeps over here in the early hours. . Standing proud in the hollow of the land. A vestige of deeper purity etched in spirit agaisnt the sky. . The menhir had runes carved in limbs of oaken sovereignty. and could see the ages growing from within the palms. I can feel the era slipping into oblivion<comma>. no longer grasping the textures. I am slowly becoming stone. . As wolves celebrate the dusk<comma>. an old voice of wisdom haunts the vale. . Shapes flicker in the fire light through the windows. The woodlands burn with grace. Their silence drowns the age. . As wandering ghosts pass through the flames. A new age of rebirth lights the dawn. . But who are they who pass by the window?. The shapes; like black solar wheels scorched in the snow. by gods of the stone.... This elder stone shall never fall!. . Cast the aeons into the void. So that no other can seek them. No age<comma> no hands shall taint them. Pour the sorrows into the sun. They are lost forever in dark woods of time. Carve the symbols into the stone. So that another can find them. No age<comma> no hands shall change them. Pour the ages into the sun. They are lost forever in the dark woods of time,angry.============0e94849db4bf2581b658384b0be80c72.lyrics.txt

Blue textures cascade downward to the base of the monolith. Like brush strokes on a canvas of souls. Two arms reach out a cloak of silent nihil. Revenants untouched by the scythe. They are lost in the dark woods of time. . Aloft in the landscape that you hail. I am the fog that seeps over here in the early hours. . Standing proud in the hollow of the land. A vestige of deeper purity etched in spirit agaisnt the sky. . The menhir had runes carved in limbs of oaken sovereignty. and could see the ages growing from within the palms. I can feel the era slipping into oblivion<comma>. no longer grasping the textures. I am slowly becoming stone. . As wolves celebrate the dusk<comma>. an old voice of wisdom haunts the vale. . Shapes flicker in the fire light through the windows. The woodlands burn with grace. Their silence drowns the age. . As wandering ghosts pass through the flames. A new age of rebirth lights the dawn. . But who are they who pass by the window?. The shapes; like black solar wheels scorched in the snow. by gods of the stone.... This elder stone shall never fall!. . Cast the aeons into the void. So that no other can seek them. No age<comma> no hands shall taint them. Pour the sorrows into the sun. They are lost forever in dark woods of time. Carve the symbols into the stone. So that another can find them. No age<comma> no hands shall change them. Pour the ages into the sun.

at night we crossed the border following a Black robe. to the edge of the reservation—to Cataldo Mission. where the saints and all the martyrs look down on dying converts. . . Yeah. It's my home—last night I dreamt that I grew wings. I found a place where they could hear me when I sing.. . and so they came with cameras—breaking through the morning mist. press and businessmen—tycoons—Episcopal philanthropists. lost in their appraisal of the body of a woman. but all we saw were lowlands—clouds clung to mountains without strings. . and at last we saw some people... . at last we saw some people.... at last we saw some people huddled up against. the rain that was descending like railroad spikes and hammers. they were headed for the border—walking and then running. and then they were gone into the fog but Anne said underneath their jackets she saw wings,calm.============8a88ba7ffd5217b66304345799fa884e.lyrics.txt

Blue textures cascade downward to the base of the monolith. Like brush strokes on a canvas of souls. Two arms reach out a cloak of silent nihil. Revenants untouched by the scythe. They are lost in the dark woods of time. . Aloft in the landscape that you hail. I am the fog that seeps over here in the early hours. . Standing proud in the hollow of the land. A vestige of deeper purity etched in spirit agaisnt the sky. . The menhir had runes carved in limbs of oaken sovereignty. and could see the ages growing from within the palms. I can feel the era slipping into oblivion<comma>. no longer grasping the textures. I am slowly becoming stone. . As wolves celebrate the dusk<comma>. an old voice of wisdom haunts the vale. . Shapes flicker in the fire light through the windows. The woodlands burn with grace. Their silence drowns the age. . As wandering ghosts pass through the flames. A new age of rebirth lights the dawn. . But who are they who pass by the window?. The shapes; like black solar wheels scorched in the snow. by gods of the stone.... This elder stone shall never fall!. . Cast the aeons into the void. So that no other can seek them. No age<comma> no hands shall taint them. Pour the sorrows into the sun. They are lost forever in dark woods of time. Carve the symbols into the stone. So that another can find them. No age<comma> no hands shall change them. Pour the ages into the sun.

Cigarettes and carrot juice. Get yourself a new tattoo. For those sleeveless days of June. I'm sitting on the Cafe Xeno's steps. With a book I haven't started yet. Watching all the girls walk by. .

Now he's searching for the ring. the one she had to throw away. beach comber casts a shadow. long as his beard. never thought to cut it since his lover disappeared . she left him in this crazy state he's in . scouring the shoreline oh looking for the ring. oh the ring that was wrapped around her finger. she was just a dream and he was just a dreamer. there's a rhythm to his madness. a rhythm that he's in. retracing all the steps he walked. where once he was a king. his heart jolts awake to the beeps of. his machine starts racing faster faster. till it's a steady stream. he riffles through every grain of sand. one for everything that slipped through his hands. and his friends have all gone. gone with the tide. and he's standing on the shoreline. stranded in time. beach combing for his lost gold. something to have and to hold. oh small fortunes they sat and stay. too long to wash away. sweat dripping from his head. like a bridal shower. and dampening the gleaming sand. but mixed with tears so sour. coz he is just a dreamer . she was just a dream. he is just a dreamer. she was just a dream. he is just a dreamer she is just a dream . she is just a dream his is just a dreamer. she was just a dream . he is just a dreamer,groovy.============3774ca26c2268a5a625e3e709fd7890d.lyrics.txt
An ancient business<comma> a modern piece of glass work. Down on the corner that you walk each day in passing. The elderly sales clerk won't eye us with suspicion. The whole immortal corporation's given its permission. . A little stairway<comma> a little piece of carpet. A pair of mirrors that are facing one another. Out in both directions a thousand little Julia's. That come together in the middle of Manhattan. . You waited since lunch. It all comes at once. . Around the corner<comma> the house that modern art built. I ask for modern art to keep it out the closets. The people who might own it<comma> the sins of pride and envy. And on the second floor the Richard Serra Skate Park. . You waited since lunch. It all comes at once. . Sit on the park wall<comma> ask all the right questions.

As someone sets light to the first fire of autumn. We settle down to cut ourselves apart. Cough and twitch from the news on your face. And some foreign candle burning in your eyes. .

at night we crossed the border following a Black robe. to the edge of the reservation—to Cataldo Mission. where the saints and all the martyrs look down on dying converts. . . Yeah. It's my home—last night I dreamt that I grew wings. I found a place where they could hear me when I sing.. . and so they came with cameras—breaking through the morning mist. press and businessmen—tycoons—Episcopal philanthropists. lost in their appraisal of the body of a woman. but all we saw were lowlands—clouds clung to mountains without strings. . and at last we saw some people... . at last we saw some people.... at last we saw some people huddled up against. the rain that was descending like railroad spikes and hammers. they were headed for the border—walking and then running. and then they were gone into the fog but Anne said underneath their jackets she saw wings,calm.============8a88ba7ffd5217b66304345799fa884e.lyrics.txt

Blue textures cascade downward to the base of the monolith. Like brush strokes on a canvas of souls. Two arms reach out a cloak of silent nihil. Revenants untouched by the scythe. They are lost in the dark woods of time. . Aloft in the landscape that you hail. I am the fog that seeps over here in the early hours. . Standing proud in the hollow of the land. A vestige of deeper purity etched in spirit agaisnt the sky. . The menhir had runes carved in limbs of oaken sovereignty. and could see the ages growing from within the palms. I can feel the era slipping into oblivion<comma>. no longer grasping the textures. I am slowly becoming stone. . As wolves celebrate the dusk<comma>. an old voice of wisdom haunts the vale. . Shapes flicker in the fire light through the windows. The woodlands burn with grace. Their silence drowns the age. . As wandering ghosts pass through the flames. A new age of rebirth lights the dawn. . But who are they who pass by the window?. The shapes; like black solar wheels scorched in the snow. by gods of the stone.... This elder stone shall never fall!. . Cast the aeons into the void. So that no other can seek them. No age<comma> no hands shall taint them. Pour the sorrows into the sun. They are lost forever in dark woods of time. Carve the symbols into the stone. So that another can find them. No age<comma> no hands shall change them. Pour the ages into the sun.

I found a place where they could hear me when I sing.. . and so they came with cameras—breaking through the morning mist. press and businessmen—tycoons—Episcopal philanthropists. lost in their appraisal of the body of a woman. but all we saw were lowlands—clouds clung to mountains without strings. . and at last we saw some people... . at last we saw some people.... at last we saw some people huddled up against. the rain that was descending like railroad spikes and hammers. they were headed for the border—walking and then running. and then they were gone into the fog but Anne said underneath their jackets she saw wings,calm.============8a88ba7ffd5217b66304345799fa884e.lyrics.txt
At the starting of the week. At summit talks you'll hear them speak. It's only Monday. Negotiations breaking down. See those leaders start to frown. It's sword and gun day. . Tomorrow never comes until it's too late. . You could be sitting taking lunch. The news will hit you like a punch. It's only Tuesday. You never thought we'd go to war. After all the things we saw. It's April Fools day. . Tomorrow never comes until it's too late. . We'll all go running underground. And we'll be listening for the sound. It's only Wednesday. In your shelter dimly lit.

You feel a shaking on the ground. A billion candles burn around. Is it your birthday?. . Tomorrow never comes until it's too late. . Although that shelter is your home. A living space you have outgrown. It's only Friday. As you come out to the light. Can your eyes behold the sight?. It must be doomsday. . Tomorrow never comes until it's too late. .

Blue textures cascade downward to the base of the monolith. Like brush strokes on a canvas of souls. Two arms reach out a cloak of silent nihil. Revenants untouched by the scythe. They are lost in the dark woods of time. . Aloft in the landscape that you hail. I am the fog that seeps over here in the early hours. . Standing proud in the hollow of the land. A vestige of deeper purity etched in spirit agaisnt the sky. . The menhir had runes carved in limbs of oaken sovereignty. and could see the ages growing from within the palms. I can feel the era slipping into oblivion<comma>. no longer grasping the textures. I am slowly becoming stone. . As wolves celebrate the dusk<comma>. an old voice of wisdom haunts the vale. . Shapes flicker in the fire light through the windows. The woodlands burn with grace. Their silence drowns the age. . As wandering ghosts pass through the flames. A new age of rebirth lights the dawn. . But who are they who pass by the window?. The shapes; like black solar wheels scorched in the snow. by gods of the stone.... This elder stone shall never fall!. . Cast the aeons into the void. So that no other can seek them. No age<comma> no hands shall taint them. Pour the sorrows into the sun. They are lost forever in dark woods of time. Carve the symbols into the stone. So that another can find them. No age<comma> no hands shall change them. Pour the ages into the sun.

Blue textures cascade downward to the base of the monolith. Like brush strokes on a canvas of souls. Two arms reach out a cloak of silent nihil. Revenants untouched by the scythe. They are lost in the dark woods of time. . Aloft in the landscape that you hail. I am the fog that seeps over here in the early hours. . Standing proud in the hollow of the land. A vestige of deeper purity etched in spirit agaisnt the sky. . The menhir had runes carved in limbs of oaken sovereignty. and could see the ages growing from within the palms. I can feel the era slipping into oblivion<comma>. no longer grasping the textures. I am slowly becoming stone. . As wolves celebrate the dusk<comma>. an old voice of wisdom haunts the vale. . Shapes flicker in the fire light through the windows. The woodlands burn with grace. Their silence drowns the age. . As wandering ghosts pass through the flames. A new age of rebirth lights the dawn. . But who are they who pass by the window?. The shapes; like black solar wheels scorched in the snow. by gods of the stone.... This elder stone shall never fall!. . Cast the aeons into the void. So that no other can seek them. No age<comma> no hands shall taint them. Pour the sorrows into the sun.

It's my home—last night I dreamt that I grew wings. I found a place where they could hear me when I sing.. . and so they came with cameras—breaking through the morning mist. press and businessmen—tycoons—Episcopal philanthropists. lost in their appraisal of the body of a woman. but all we saw were lowlands—clouds clung to mountains without strings. . and at last we saw some people... . at last we saw some people.... at last we saw some people huddled up against. the rain that was descending like railroad spikes and hammers. they were headed for the border—walking and then running. and then they were gone into the fog but Anne said underneath their jackets she saw wings,calm.============8a88ba7ffd5217b66304345799fa884e.lyrics.txt

Always thought she'd stick around. always thought she'd stay. Now he's searching for the ring. the one she had to throw away. beach comber casts a shadow. long as his beard. never thought to cut it since his lover disappeared . she left him in this crazy state he's in . scouring the shoreline oh looking for the ring. oh the ring that was wrapped around her finger. she was just a dream and he was just a dreamer. there's a rhythm to his madness. a rhythm that he's in. retracing all the steps he walked. where once he was a king. his heart jolts awake to the beeps of. his machine starts racing faster faster. till it's a steady stream. he riffles through every grain of sand. one for everything that slipped through his hands. and his friends have all gone. gone with the tide. and he's standing on the shoreline. stranded in time. beach combing for his lost gold. something to have and to hold. oh small fortunes they sat and stay. too long to wash away. sweat dripping from his head. like a bridal shower. and dampening the gleaming sand. but mixed with tears so sour. coz he is just a dreamer . she was just a dream. he is just a dreamer. she was just a dream. he is just a dreamer she is just a dream . she is just a dream his is just a dreamer. she was just a dream . he is just a dreamer,groovy.============3774ca26c2268a5a625e3e709fd7890d.lyrics.txt

It's my home—last night I dreamt that I grew wings. I found a place where they could hear me when I sing.. . and so they came with cameras—breaking through the morning mist. press and businessmen—tycoons—Episcopal philanthropists. lost in their appraisal of the body of a woman. but all we saw were lowlands—clouds clung to mountains without strings. . and at last we saw some people... . at last we saw some people.... at last we saw some people huddled up against. the rain that was descending like railroad spikes and hammers. they were headed for the border—walking and then running. and then they were gone into the fog but Anne said underneath their jackets she saw wings,calm.============8a88ba7ffd5217b66304345799fa884e.lyrics.txt

Blue textures cascade downward to the base of the monolith. Like brush strokes on a canvas of souls. Two arms reach out a cloak of silent nihil. Revenants untouched by the scythe. They are lost in the dark woods of time. . Aloft in the landscape that you hail. I am the fog that seeps over here in the early hours. . Standing proud in the hollow of the land. A vestige of deeper purity etched in spirit agaisnt the sky. . The menhir had runes carved in limbs of oaken sovereignty. and could see the ages growing from within the palms. I can feel the era slipping into oblivion<comma>. no longer grasping the textures. I am slowly becoming stone. . As wolves celebrate the dusk<comma>. an old voice of wisdom haunts the vale. . Shapes flicker in the fire light through the windows. The woodlands burn with grace. Their silence drowns the age. . As wandering ghosts pass through the flames. A new age of rebirth lights the dawn. . But who are they who pass by the window?. The shapes; like black solar wheels scorched in the snow. by gods of the stone....
