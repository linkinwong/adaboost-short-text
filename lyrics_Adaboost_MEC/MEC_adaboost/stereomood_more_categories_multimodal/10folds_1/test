My mother was a Chinese trapeze artist in pre-war Paris . Smuggling bombs for the underground. And she met my father at a fete in Aix-en-Provence. He was disguised as a Russian cadet in the employ of the Axis.  . And there in the half-light of the provincial midnight . To a lone concertina they drank in cantinas . And toasted to Edith Piaf and the fall of the Reich. . My sister was born in a hovel in Burgundy . And left for the cattle but later was found by a communist. Who had deserted his ranks to follow his dream . To start up a punk rock band in South Carolina. . And I get letters sometimes surprisingly raised with tender care . Til the money got tight and they bet me away . To a blind brigadier in a game of high stakes canasta. . But he made me a sailor on his brigadier ship fleet. I know every yardarm from main mast to jib sheet. But sometimes I long to be landlocked . And to work in a bakery,sad.============6b0e1c47864e8f93868e46c9d29a7eb5.lyrics.txt

You never hear me talk about one day getting out. Why put a new address on the same old loneliness. Everybody knows where that is. We built that house of his. And when he's not home. Someone else you know always is. If Heaven's really coming back. I hope it has a heart attack. When they see how dangerous it is for guys like that. The night has always known when it's time to get going. When it's really been so long that it starts showing. It's always had that ghost who always almost. Tells me the Secret. How there's really no difference in who he was once. And who he's become. Everything you hated me for… Honey there was so much more. I just didn't get busted.. But I'm not looking for an easy way out. This whole life it's been about. Try and try and try. And try and try and try. To be simple again,sad.============d8d1a5373201f4fa9454d3b987d8dd5d.lyrics.txt

And the big red wasp . Makes a scan through . My black pages . . Last night our boy was out there . Burning up his matches . I saw him in the afternoon . Sporting a black eye . . The universal man . Holds a pistol or a bottle . Types with confidence . As we grow out of our . Bruises . . Once i had a friend . Who had the knack of tossing . His mind around geography . Boy you think you have problems . . The hunter is asleep . At least that's what i call him . In the afternoon . Of the new cobweb . Summer,sad.============4f03254d1f1b9da91cf90e26a4df3700.lyrics.txt

Don't you know that I'll be around to guide you . Through your weakest moments to leave them behind you . Returning nightmares only shadows . We'll cast some light and you'll be alright for now . Crosses all over heavy on your shoulders . The sirens inside you waiting to step forward . Disturbing silence darkens your sight . We'll cast some light and you'll be alright for now .

Ignore them tonight and you'll be alright . We'll cast some light and you'll be alright,sad.============eab49eb6c923cf30f5fcf6630fabf8af.lyrics.txt

Take a last look around. Take the fall that is due. Hey or better men. It is not something that love would allow. . Oh you can't throw something out there without watching it fall. Only thing that's scarier than dying is not dying at all. So when I have lost all my control. God will rest my soul. . And just like how I'll drink myself through my seventh relapse.

I hear the tiniest sparks and the tenderest sounds. Diving music. Drowning the sound. Waltzing with the hairs upon my arms. Then your fight or flight alarm. And you tremble . Then you stumble. And you scrape up your palms. . I can't stay here to hold your hand. I've been away for so long. I've lost my taste for home. And that's a dirty fallow feeling.... To be the dangling ceiling.

The lines come out and struggle with. The empty voice that speaks. . Her heart is oh so tired now. Of kindnesses gone by. Like broken glasses in a drain. Gone down but not well spent. The road from Barbary to here. She sold then stole right back. The vanity insanity her hungry heart forgave. The fading bride's dull beauty grows. Just begging to be seen. Beneath the magic lights that reach from . Barbary to here. . Her schoolhouse mind has windows now. Where handsome creatures come to watch. The anaesthetic wearing off. Antarctica starts here,sad.============ae3d954f436f95b2a3a509c508d09e83.lyrics.txt
I find the map and draw a straight line . Over rivers farms and state lines . The distance from A to where you'd B. It's only finger lengths that I see . . I touch the place . Where I'd find your face . My fingers in creases . Of distant dark places . . I hang my coat up in the first bar . There is no peace that I've found so far . The laughter penetrates my silence . As drunken men find flaws in science . . Their words mostly noises . Ghosts with just voices . Your words in my memory . Are like music to me . . And miles from where you are . I lay down on the cold ground and I. I pray that something picks me up . And sets me down in your warm arms . . After I have traveled so far . We'd set the fire to the third bar . We'd share each other like an island . Until exhausted close our eyelids . . And dreaming pick up from . The last place we left off . Your soft skin is weeping . A joy you can't keep in . . And miles from where you are . I lay down on the cold ground and I. I pray that something picks me up . And sets me down in your warm arms. . And miles from where you are . I lay down on the cold ground and I. I pray that something picks me up . And sets me down in your warm arms,sad.============496dcc7a4a011701517652eca6d0c941.lyrics.txt
You always come to the parties. Too bad the feathers are for the birds. On your knees. I will not let you grieve. . I want your picture but not your words. You know the wanting. You can not call me your heart. . Jack of all trades. Master of none. Cry all the time. Cause i'm not having fun. . You always want to be forgiven. The devil loves what you ask of him. All your needs. But you can not; you will not agree,sad.============b6410a89b9e74bad14cae269c79b2f11.lyrics.txt

The leading light of the age all wondered amongst. Themselves what I would do next. After all that I'd found in my travels around. The world was there anything else left?. "Gentlemen" My Santa Maria. My beautiful Annabelle Lee. . That spring we set sail as the crowd waved from shore. And on board the crew waved their hats. But I never had family just the Annabelle Lee. So I didn't have cause to look back. I just set the course north and I studied the charts. And toward dark I drifted toward sleep. And I dreamed of the fine deep harbor I'd find. Past the ice for my Annabelle Lee. . After that it got colder the world got quiet. It was never quite day or quite night. And the sea turned the color of sky turned the color. Of sea turned the color of ice. 'Til at last all around us was fastness. One vast glassy desert of arsenic white. And the waves that once lifted us. Sifted instead into drifts against Annabelle's sides. . The crew gathered closer at first for the comfort. But each morning would bring a new set. Of the tracks in the snow leading over the edge. Of the world 'til I was the only one left. After that it gets cloudy but it feels like I lay there. For days maybe for months. But Annabelle held me the two of us happy. Just to think back on all we had done. . We talked of the other worlds we'd discover. As she gave up her body to me. And as I chopped up her mainsail for timber. I told her of all that we still had to see. As the frost turned her moorings to nine-tail. And the wind lashed her sides in the cold. I burned her to keep me alive every night. In the lover's embrace of her hold. . I won't call it rescue what brought me here back to. The old world to drink and decline. And to pretend that the search for another new world. Was well-worth the burning of mine. But sometimes at night in my dreams comes the singing. Of some known tropical bird. And I smile in my sleep thinking Annabelle Lee. Has finally made it to another new world,sad.============8bb0ba4af0ed4565e9cd6e82667adf25.lyrics.txt

Where oh where have you been my love?. Where oh where can you be?. It's been so long since the moon has gone. And oh what a wreck you've made me. . Are you there over the ocean?.

And as sure as days come from moments. Each hour becomes a life's time. When she'd left I'd only begun this lullaby,sad.============61c122e6368033d3c8c55af3bd9035e0.lyrics.txt

Punctured bicycle on a hillside desolate. Will nature make a man of me yet?. When in this charming car. This charming man. . Why pamper life's complexity. When the leather runs smooth.

Rip the earth in two with your mind. And seal the urge which ensues with brass wires. I never meant you any harm. Your tears feel warm as they fall on my forearm. . But close my eyes for a while.

Did I burn each last bit of myself. Did I turn my back on the kid in myself. And tear the oldest root. In a charlatan's pursuit. And the world difting farther away. . On the run with nowhere to hide. The black angel still clings to my side. You know he's faster than. Any man. And the world drifting further away. . What I told you lover I guess that I meant. By the time that you read this I will have repented. I know I am a fool. For trying to play it cruel. And you played so much kinder than I. . Your memory now is the shadow to my shadow. I wind it tight like a player piano. Your skirt above your knees. I watch you press the keys. It calms the smarting flesh. Of the wound we have undressed. . If still there's a song deep in this marrow. Who lets you draw that last shivering arrow. What kind of smarting loon. Believes that he can shoot the moon. Calm these frailing nerves. They ask to be preserved. . I was ashamed and mute. Fumbling around for my parachute. Then gliding through the rain. Not a drop could leave its stain. And the world drifting farther away,sad.============acf6567d9e847a5ec40710b2444bf28a.lyrics.txt

at night we crossed the border following a Black robe. to the edge of the reservation—to Cataldo Mission. where the saints and all the martyrs look down on dying converts. . . Yeah. It's my home—last night I dreamt that I grew wings. I found a place where they could hear me when I sing.. . and so they came with cameras—breaking through the morning mist. press and businessmen—tycoons—Episcopal philanthropists. lost in their appraisal of the body of a woman. but all we saw were lowlands—clouds clung to mountains without strings. . and at last we saw some people... . at last we saw some people.... at last we saw some people huddled up against. the rain that was descending like railroad spikes and hammers. they were headed for the border—walking and then running. and then they were gone into the fog but Anne said underneath their jackets she saw wings,sad.============8a88ba7ffd5217b66304345799fa884e.lyrics.txt

Before the world you know was like it is. I held a lover once and I was his. And we walked along the river in the sun. But he's a lonely man so this was done. The only place we had to meet was night.

Now does it beg?. . Your thin frame has set my eyes to fray. On our dim stretch of this street how it aches. For every grey and sad and taut to coil. And our frail eyes and there watch to finally talk. . One brash phrase cut crush these fragile days. My thoughts swirl in some shrill sad cannonade. And one such spur that caused my throat to creak. The one dull dawn that I've since sensed to repeat,calm.============1496a7b94739818f1f1199ed457f0368.lyrics.txt

And the memory of our sacred so and so's. . Oh take my hand sweet . Complete your release. Unbury your feet . And married we'll be. Alone in receiving ours is a feeling. Not that they would see.

And now a road connects the cul-de-sac. To the adjacent development. But there used to be trees stretching back. And there was no way through. . And I was thankful for the mystery. But by the time that girl had hanged herself. I could have looked out my back window. And watched her neck just snap. . Baseball field lights that shine. Over the shedding pine.

She's just a pale fleshy typewriter-light advertisement for a wind chime that emits rays which resonate in the polluted sky. . All entrances to the. Merritt blocked off I mean.

at night we crossed the border following a Black robe. to the edge of the reservation—to Cataldo Mission. where the saints and all the martyrs look down on dying converts. . . Yeah. It's my home—last night I dreamt that I grew wings. I found a place where they could hear me when I sing.. . and so they came with cameras—breaking through the morning mist. press and businessmen—tycoons—Episcopal philanthropists. lost in their appraisal of the body of a woman. but all we saw were lowlands—clouds clung to mountains without strings. . and at last we saw some people... . at last we saw some people.... at last we saw some people huddled up against. the rain that was descending like railroad spikes and hammers. they were headed for the border—walking and then running. and then they were gone into the fog but Anne said underneath their jackets she saw wings,calm.============8a88ba7ffd5217b66304345799fa884e.lyrics.txt

Take some wool and learn to knit. Cause it's a long day. . Tomorrow never comes until it's too late. . You hear a whistling overhead. Are you alive or are you dead?. It's only Thursday. You feel a shaking on the ground. A billion candles burn around. Is it your birthday?. . Tomorrow never comes until it's too late. . Although that shelter is your home. A living space you have outgrown. It's only Friday. As you come out to the light. Can your eyes behold the sight?. It must be doomsday. . Tomorrow never comes until it's too late. . Ain't it funny how men think. They made the bomb they are extinct. It's only Saturday. . I think tomorrow's come I think it's too late. I think tomorrow's come I think it's too late.

Critical eyes are gazing . Fat cows are grazing . My eyes are glazing . How can you see straight with all the lies . I'm too young . You think you're old . Why don't you just hold me cold . I don't like it when you talk about yourself like that . It changes the way that I feel . There'll be no bad dreams . When you're lying next to me . I don't care about the rules . We only answer to ourselves . Answer to ourselves . Why does my sleep tell me of lies . Waking life full of rotten surprise . Why do all the strangers care . Who knows who is there . If you are here and I am where? . Trapped in the cell of your own brain . Blood is scarcely moving through your shriveled veins . Don't let yourself pass you by . It can happen in the blink of an eye . There'll be no bad dreams . When you're lying next to me . I don't care about the rules . We only answer to ourselves . Until we fall awake . I feel old now you seem young . I spent too much time out in the sun . I got a wrinkle to show for every day . Give 'em back to me again . I'll spend them the same,calm.============b5b49b5b2e990aac3a44a6e0549ed31d.lyrics.txt

Le serenate all'istituto magistrale. nell'ora di ginnastica o di religione. per carnevale suonavo sopra i carri in maschera. avevo già la Luna e Urano nel Leone. "il mare nel cassetto". "le mille bolle blu". da quando sei andata via non esisto più. "il mondo è grigio il mondo è blu".. . Cuccurucucu Paloma.... . L'ira funesta dei profughi afghani. che dal confine si spostarono nell'Iran. cantami o diva dei pellerossa americani. le gesta erotiche di squaw "Pelle di Luna". le penne stilografiche con l'inchiostro blu. la barba col rasoio elettrico non la faccio più. "il mondo è grigio il mondo è blu".. . Cuccurucucu Paloma.... . Lady madonna. I can try. with a little help from my friends. oh oh goodbye Ruby tuesday. come on baby let's twist again. once upon a time. you dressed so fine Mary. like just a woman. like a rolling stone.. .

Did I burn each last bit of myself. Did I turn my back on the kid in myself. And tear the oldest root. In a charlatan's pursuit. And the world difting farther away. . On the run with nowhere to hide. The black angel still clings to my side. You know he's faster than. Any man. And the world drifting further away. . What I told you lover I guess that I meant. By the time that you read this I will have repented. I know I am a fool. For trying to play it cruel. And you played so much kinder than I. . Your memory now is the shadow to my shadow. I wind it tight like a player piano. Your skirt above your knees. I watch you press the keys. It calms the smarting flesh. Of the wound we have undressed. . If still there's a song deep in this marrow. Who lets you draw that last shivering arrow. What kind of smarting loon. Believes that he can shoot the moon. Calm these frailing nerves. They ask to be preserved. . I was ashamed and mute. Fumbling around for my parachute. Then gliding through the rain. Not a drop could leave its stain. And the world drifting farther away,lonely.============acf6567d9e847a5ec40710b2444bf28a.lyrics.txt

Ed is a portal. Ed is a portal. And damned if we don't try. . To sort of relinquish the reigns our. Brains their mass has gravity. Pulls us into and away from. Portals such as Fractal Ed's. Mysterioso displacement. Porportioned anti subtle bubble. Gun unarmed the torsos run but they. Cannot grasp the antelope hunter. Made his weapons out of sticks. Thinking drinking from the sun. Her moonbeams birth mercurial babies. Antelopes run free and the sea it returns me. . To all of the places that I have known. . Now that my body's grown the lonely heart poetry. Droning in hearts becomes songs that all objects. Sing to each other like friends telling stories. . It's all the same story. And Ed is a portal. . The immorals gently awaken. All possibilities open. Unto one another. And brothers and sisters begin. To see truly through strata,high.============09482749385bd418edf059e3ca2fedd8.lyrics.txt

Esta è la storia verdadera de sombrero. caballero della pampa. amigo del pueblo amigo de dios. andale manito ermano con coraje e corazon. nacque già sopra un cavallo. aveva un fucile e un mantello nero. lo chiamarono Pedro Felippe. però per la gente è solo Sombrero. teneva timore de Dios. e il pelo cortato e il cuore caliente. viveva sempre da solo. col suo sombrero ma amava la gente. e sparava correva rideva giocava. cantava una canzone. una storia di sangue una storia d'amore. quando sparava era fermo. la mano sicura puntava al cuore. rubava ma solo per dare. la roba del ricco al povero nero. nessuno l'ha mai incontrato. ma ogni peone ama solo Sombrero. e sparava correva giocava barava. forse cercava un amigo. una birra un mantello o chissà che altra cosa. si seppe molto più tardi. Sombrero cantava e cercava una sposa. sembra che erano in dieci. quel giorno a seguire nella pampa Sombrero. un colpo di fuoco nel cuore. spezzò la vita del caballero. che amava soffriva rideva moriva. nessuno l'ha visto morire. per questo la gente sa che non è vero. negli occhi di chi ha sofferto. c'è una speranza un amico Sombrero. e cantando le sue canzoni. le storie di sangue le storie d'amore. anche se lui non c'è più. ha lasciato al paese un po' del suo cuore.,funny.============7d82d42229fa470c2268b460e3f5dcb2.lyrics.txt

Generals gathered in their masses. Just like witches at black masses. Evil minds that plot destruction. Sorcerers of death's construction. In the fields the bodies burning. As the war machine keeps turning. Death and hatred to mankind. Poisoning their brainwashed minds. Oh Lord yeah!. . Politicians hide themselves away. They only started the war. Why should they go out to fight. They leave their role to the poor. . Time will tell on their power minds. Making war just for fun. Treating people just like pawns in chess. Wait 'till their judgment day comes. . Now in darkness world stops turning. Ashes where their bodies burning. No more war pigs have the power. Hand of God has struck the hour. Day of judgment God is calling. On their knees the war pigs crawling. Begging mercy for their sins. Satan laughing spreads his wings.

As the descent began I got the distinct impression. Lake Michigan had been frozen for decades. I conducted the warmth from my metronome sternum. To our massive jetting vessel billowing plumes of spent fuel. . The tundra under us cracked and ruptured. To reveal palisades. Made of blades of gray gray bristling grass. And papulose lichen. I was so frightened. As my grip on you tightened. Your skin got slicker. . I am a deserted bus depot. Though our approach suggested. An American hazy sea. Like the one I found inside. After driving you home once. Still half high. . I-90 through utter desolation. I sense evil at the heart of each far flung well lighted home. I close my eyes and see cellar stairways. Vermiculated with delicate animal bone. . Musty rooms house racks of fur jackets. Spattered with plasma. On a bus in Indiana. I called you and screamed. Under ceaseless patterns of weeping light,happy.============6689266087fd4026918282281653d575.lyrics.txt

And it's the same across the nation. Black & white discrimination. They're yellin' ";You can't understand me!";. And all the other crap they hand me. In the papers and TV. 'N all that mass stupidity. That seems to grow more every day. Each time you hear some nitwit say. He wants to go and do you in. Because the color of your skin. Just don't appeal to him. (No matter if it's black or white). Because he's out for blood tonight. You know we gotta sit around at home. And watch this thing begin. But I bet there won't be many left. To see it really end. 'Cause the fire in the street. Ain't like the fire in my heart. And in the eyes of all these people. Don't you know that this could start. On any street in any town. In any state if any clown. Decides that now's the time to fight. For some ideal he thinks is right. And if a million more agree. There ain't no great society. As it applies to you and me. Our country isn't free. And the law refuses to see. If all that you can ever be. Is just a lousy janitor. Unless your uncle owns a store. You know that five in every four. Just one amount and nothin' more. Don't watch the rats go across the floor. And make up songs about being poor. Blow you harmonica son!,high.============e561467dee4ab5b96f6ac518a2ba7fc3.lyrics.txt

All I can ever be to you is a darkness that we knew. And this regret I got accustomed to. Once it was so right when we were at our height. Waiting for you in the hotel at night. . I knew I hadn't met my match but every moment we could snatch. I don't know why I got so attached. It's my responsibility you don't owe nothing to me. But to walk away the sun goes down. He takes the day but I'm gone. And in your way in this blue shade. My tears dry on their own. . He walks away the sun goes down. He takes the day but I'm gone. And in your way my deep shade. My tears dry,sad.============76c8f78780d8d557b3df2eb9698cb6b4.lyrics.txt

All I feel is in this data stream. I see the eyes in the computer screen. Misinformation is surrounding me. It brings me down to disappear. . The jury's out and the rewards are in.

The world goes beep beep beep. But you go ooh ooh ahh. Ooh ooh ahh. . My car goes beep beep beep. The time goes beep beep beep. The world goes beep beep beep. But you go ooh ooh ahh.

All I need is some sunshine. All I need.... All I need is some sunshine. All I need.... . The siren called beyond the treeline. With another one for the caves. And in the tarn beyond those birches. Is a spirit that I crave. . And from the island people watched you. You set that viking ship ablaze. We reached the moon falls icy cauldron. And found the spirit that I crave. .

All there years you've been speaking without breathing. Spinning closer to the sun. Had your way with an unsuspecting public. Little threads are all it takes. La la la la .... I have learned all your secrets so familiar. I know where you lay your head. Fear of god and a disappointing father. Holds the hand around your neck. La la la la .... Sometimes I could just choke myself with laughter. Sometimes everything's so true. So when you come down from your death-defying labors. I'll still be in love with you.

Now does it beg?. . Your thin frame has set my eyes to fray. On our dim stretch of this street how it aches. For every grey and sad and taut to coil. And our frail eyes and there watch to finally talk. . One brash phrase cut crush these fragile days. My thoughts swirl in some shrill sad cannonade. And one such spur that caused my throat to creak. The one dull dawn that I've since sensed to repeat,calm.============1496a7b94739818f1f1199ed457f0368.lyrics.txt
A long time you waited. You thought it had abated. Shame of it all. The harm that it causes. Pours down like a faucet. Shame of it all,calm.============cf3af61e9a9d4210e39c6217076c97c3.lyrics.txt

Alors tu vois comme tout se mêle. Et du cœur à tes lèvres je deviens un casse-tête. Ton rire me crie de te lâcher. Avant de perdre prise et d'abandonner. . Car je ne t'en demanderai jamais autant.

Andalucia when can I see you. When it is snowing out again. Farmer John wants you. Louder and softer closer and nearer. Then again. Needing you taking you keeping you leaving you. In a year and a day to be sure. That your face doesn't alter. Your words never falter -- I love you. . I'll be here waiting later and later. Hoping the night will go away. Andalucia Castles and Christians. Andalucia come to stay. You were lost on a day much like this. When you'd made up your mind not to come. And I couldn't persuade you. Or wait till tomorrow -- or pass the time,sad.============56534c095683e21dbaeaa52fad489e17.lyrics.txt
Anda my love. Wake up to your window . The day calls in billows . It's echoing moonlight onto the blue nightmare of your heart. In cosy red rainbow . It's shaking off halos . And the memory of our sacred so and so's. . Oh take my hand sweet . Complete your release. Unbury your feet . And married we'll be. Alone in receiving ours is a feeling. Not that they would see. They don't know that we could be . Down where your cradle escaped the sea . And your raven-haired mama caught told you so's. . We're laying in the shadow of your family tree . Your haunted heart and me. Brought down by an old idea whose time has come . And in the shadow of the gallows of your family tree . There's a hundred hearts or three. Pumping blood to the roots of evil to keep them young . . Ah me all mine. Is it safe to say that we've waited patiently . Call me on time . And recall the tune that has placed us gracefully . All into line . There's a garden grave and a place there saved for you . I fall by your side . Though your silver-haired mama throws told-you so's . . We're laying in the shadow of your family tree. Your haunted heart and me. Brought down by an old idea whose time has come. And in the shadow of the gallows of your family tree. There's a hundred hearts or three. Pumping blood to the roots of evil to keep them young. . Now we're gathered in the shadow of your family tree. In halted harmony. Brought down by an old idea whose time has come .

And now a road connects the cul-de-sac. To the adjacent development. But there used to be trees stretching back. And there was no way through. . And I was thankful for the mystery. But by the time that girl had hanged herself. I could have looked out my back window. And watched her neck just snap. . Baseball field lights that shine. Over the shedding pine. Each bulb's a blinding sphere. In the secular nation. Unhurried sirens moan. Pitches that glaze my eyes. She's just a pale fleshy typewriter-light advertisement for a wind chime that emits rays which resonate in the polluted sky. . All entrances to the. Merritt blocked off I mean. I'd love to believe that death's. Just the beginning as the. Shutters fly open and the. Breeze gives me pause. I know what's out there. morning phone calls silence and resentment and craters a new moon built in a line,energetic.============597e4650f587aa08e7a57b2a9fab97e5.lyrics.txt

at night we crossed the border following a Black robe. to the edge of the reservation—to Cataldo Mission. where the saints and all the martyrs look down on dying converts. . . Yeah. It's my home—last night I dreamt that I grew wings. I found a place where they could hear me when I sing.. . and so they came with cameras—breaking through the morning mist. press and businessmen—tycoons—Episcopal philanthropists. lost in their appraisal of the body of a woman. but all we saw were lowlands—clouds clung to mountains without strings. . and at last we saw some people... . at last we saw some people.... at last we saw some people huddled up against. the rain that was descending like railroad spikes and hammers. they were headed for the border—walking and then running. and then they were gone into the fog but Anne said underneath their jackets she saw wings,calm.============8a88ba7ffd5217b66304345799fa884e.lyrics.txt

At the starting of the week. At summit talks you'll hear them speak. It's only Monday. Negotiations breaking down. See those leaders start to frown. It's sword and gun day. . Tomorrow never comes until it's too late. . You could be sitting taking lunch. The news will hit you like a punch. It's only Tuesday. You never thought we'd go to war. After all the things we saw. It's April Fools day. . Tomorrow never comes until it's too late. . We'll all go running underground. And we'll be listening for the sound. It's only Wednesday. In your shelter dimly lit. Take some wool and learn to knit. Cause it's a long day. . Tomorrow never comes until it's too late. . You hear a whistling overhead. Are you alive or are you dead?. It's only Thursday. You feel a shaking on the ground. A billion candles burn around. Is it your birthday?. . Tomorrow never comes until it's too late. . Although that shelter is your home. A living space you have outgrown. It's only Friday. As you come out to the light. Can your eyes behold the sight?. It must be doomsday. . Tomorrow never comes until it's too late. . Ain't it funny how men think. They made the bomb they are extinct. It's only Saturday. . I think tomorrow's come I think it's too late. I think tomorrow's come I think it's too late. Think tomorrow's come I think it's too late,sad.============393d61c83f06b9fefa6ab70659a2d6c6.lyrics.txt

Sometimes your voice is not enough,sad.============57a95a82c0a7113c91d5cd322df8944d.lyrics.txt

Baby canteen cause they think it's a masterpiece. . The sky has brakes . What a good day to rise. De Soto De Son will time. . Goodbye blue heron goodbye green fly goodbye goodbye. . I've got a raft you'll sail till the open lie in the lake. While your body is broken . When you go out I'll cry in the thicket. Shooting from school. There's a green where the crickets cry mom can't breathe and i know she's leaving. And that the birds of a quay are all good for the crocodile. So slow it down. Its not a race. Death takes time. Do you see it?. . Baby canteen swollen fingers in the water . I roped an Island pony for your birthday. I'll live in wooded housing till they put out all your needles. And drop you in and shelter near the highway,calm.============990a4ba58bf79183d789c741f357196c.lyrics.txt

Baby's into running around. Hanging with the crowd. Putting your business in the street talking out loud. Saying you bought her this and that. And how much you done spent. I swear she must believe it's all heaven sent. Hey boy you better bring the chick around. To the sad. sad truth the dirty lowdown. . (Who I wonder who) taught her how to talk like that. (Who I wonder who) gave her that big idea. . Nothing you can't handle nothing you ain't got. Put the money on the table and drive it off the lot. Turn on that ole lovelight and turn a maybe to a yes. Same old schoolboy game got you into this mess. Hey son better get back to town. Face the sad old truth the dirty lowdown. . (Who I wonder who) put those ideas in your head. (Who I wonder who) yeah. Come on back down little son. Dig the low low low low lowdown. . You ain't got to be so bad got to be so cold. This dog eat dog existence sure is getting old. Got to have a Jones for this Jones for that. This running with the Joneses boy. Just ain't where it's at. You gonna come back around. To the sad sad truth the dirty lowdown. . (Who I wonder who) got you thinking like that boy. (Who I wonder who). (Who I wonder who said who I wonder who). Oh look out for that lowdown. That dirty dirty dirty dirty lowdown.

Bailey's her name and there's a price she takes. . Blurring lines while she ruthlessly raised the stakes. . And there's a mess that she made. . We kiss on the mouth with hearts that were bound and gagged. . The news was broke the witness was the Cascades. . Do you remember me? . 'Cause there's a piece of my mind in a field of dandelions. . Do you remember me? 'Cause there's a tale I tell. . It's made of rain and hell. . We will seldom speak our bodies became arsonists to will and brains. . To him the cold hearted thing was she came demanding rings. . The day was mute and hot. We will rarely talk. . I'm just where you left me alone by them lilacs.,lonely.============931d7d74fe09b523cf82e3b75a2e0329.lyrics.txt

Pretty songs and pretty places. Places that I've never seen. Pretty songs and pretty faces. Tell me what their laughter means. Some look like they'll cry forever. Tell me what their laughter means.. . If I had a buckskin stallion. I'd tame him down and ride away.. If I had a golden galleon. I'd sail into the light of day. If I had your love forever. Sail into the light of day,calm.============f9787467103ee3a00023a9439ba14539.lyrics.txt
Called to see. If your back was still aligned. And your sheets. Were growing grass all on the corners of your bed. . But you've got too much to wear on your sleeves. That has too much to do with me. And secretly I want to bury in the yard. The gray remains of a friendship scarred. . You tested your mettle. On doe skin and petals. While kissing the lipless. Who bleed all the sweetness away,happy.============1629cb692ab61c0e62a4a8d7a143773d.lyrics.txt

Calm down. And get straight. It's in our eyes. It's how we operate. . You're true. You are. I'd apologize but it won't go very far. . Please come here. Come right on over. And when we collide we'll see what gets left over. . A little joy. A little sorrow. And a little pride so we won't have to borrow. Wherever you lead tear the old one out. And I'll try to see things your way. . And I'm gonna love you anyway. Try to see things your way. Try to see things your way. Try to see things your way,calm.============9d980a547e6024906b9287d9b55751c3.lyrics.txt

As the descent began I got the distinct impression. Lake Michigan had been frozen for decades. I conducted the warmth from my metronome sternum. To our massive jetting vessel billowing plumes of spent fuel. . The tundra under us cracked and ruptured. To reveal palisades. Made of blades of gray gray bristling grass. And papulose lichen. I was so frightened. As my grip on you tightened. Your skin got slicker. . I am a deserted bus depot. Though our approach suggested. An American hazy sea. Like the one I found inside. After driving you home once. Still half high. . I-90 through utter desolation. I sense evil at the heart of each far flung well lighted home. I close my eyes and see cellar stairways. Vermiculated with delicate animal bone. . Musty rooms house racks of fur jackets. Spattered with plasma. On a bus in Indiana. I called you and screamed. Under ceaseless patterns of weeping light,happy.============6689266087fd4026918282281653d575.lyrics.txt

20 years of schooling. I just never learned the math. That one and one don't equal two. They often equal half. . I have tried to live the high life. The best that I know how. And I bought my share of debonair. And parlayed it on the crowd. . I do believe that there's no more tricks up my sleeve. The good old days have past and the good times after that. And slowly I've become undone. A stranger with a stranger heart. . Well I plan to hit the bottom. The bottle then the top. And I pray that something quits me. Before I gotta stop. . Cause the masquerade is over. But I was barely there. The mask come off the gilded cloth. Yet I'm just barely there. . I do believe that there's no more tricks up my sleeve. The good old days have past and the good times after that. And slowly I've become undone. A stranger with a stranger heart,funny.============83ab59fb0ff015e651cf3cf50f83301b.lyrics.txt

A long stone and my day's all serpentine. The tired tarnish in my chest rests sense of SARS. And one dull dawn where they hum that splits its length. Does my name sting your tongue?  Now does it beg?. . Your thin frame has set my eyes to fray. On our dim stretch of this street how it aches. For every grey and sad and taut to coil. And our frail eyes and there watch to finally talk. . One brash phrase cut crush these fragile days. My thoughts swirl in some shrill sad cannonade. And one such spur that caused my throat to creak. The one dull dawn that I've since sensed to repeat,calm.============1496a7b94739818f1f1199ed457f0368.lyrics.txt

Always thought she'd stick around. always thought she'd stay.

Andalucia when can I see you. When it is snowing out again. Farmer John wants you. Louder and softer closer and nearer. Then again. Needing you taking you keeping you leaving you. In a year and a day to be sure. That your face doesn't alter. Your words never falter -- I love you. . I'll be here waiting later and later. Hoping the night will go away. Andalucia Castles and Christians. Andalucia come to stay. You were lost on a day much like this. When you'd made up your mind not to come. And I couldn't persuade you. Or wait till tomorrow -- or pass the time,sad.============56534c095683e21dbaeaa52fad489e17.lyrics.txt
Anda my love. Wake up to your window . The day calls in billows . It's echoing moonlight onto the blue nightmare of your heart. In cosy red rainbow . It's shaking off halos . And the memory of our sacred so and so's. . Oh take my hand sweet . Complete your release. Unbury your feet . And married we'll be. Alone in receiving ours is a feeling. Not that they would see. They don't know that we could be . Down where your cradle escaped the sea . And your raven-haired mama caught told you so's. . We're laying in the shadow of your family tree . Your haunted heart and me. Brought down by an old idea whose time has come . And in the shadow of the gallows of your family tree . There's a hundred hearts or three. Pumping blood to the roots of evil to keep them young . . Ah me all mine. Is it safe to say that we've waited patiently . Call me on time . And recall the tune that has placed us gracefully . All into line . There's a garden grave and a place there saved for you . I fall by your side . Though your silver-haired mama throws told-you so's . . We're laying in the shadow of your family tree. Your haunted heart and me. Brought down by an old idea whose time has come. And in the shadow of the gallows of your family tree. There's a hundred hearts or three.

And now a road connects the cul-de-sac. To the adjacent development. But there used to be trees stretching back. And there was no way through. . And I was thankful for the mystery. But by the time that girl had hanged herself. I could have looked out my back window. And watched her neck just snap. . Baseball field lights that shine. Over the shedding pine.

To prove no one in the sky or behind the lines. Cares we're alive,happy.============c1834dfb443ebda0e441466a5b1603af.lyrics.txt

Good morning to you I hope you're feeling better baby. Thinking of me while you are far away. Counting the days until they set you free again. Writing this letter hoping you're okay. .

When I was a young boy. My mama said to me. There's only one girl in the world for you. And she probably lives in Tahiti. . I'd go the whole wide world. I'd go the whole wide world. Just to find her. . Or maybe she's in the Bahamas. Where the Carribean sea is blue. Weeping in a tropical moonlit night. Because nobody's told her 'bout you. . I'd go the whole wide world. I'd go the whole wide world. Just to find her. I'd go the whole wide world. I'd go the whole wide world. Find out where they hide her. . Why am I hanging around in the rain out here. Trying to pick up a girl. Why are my eyes filling up with these lonely tears. When there're girls all over the world. . Is she lying on a tropical beach somewhere. Underneath the tropical sun. Pining away in a heatwave there. Hoping that I won't be long. . I should be lying on that sun-soaked beach with her. Caressing her warm brown skin. And then in a year or maybe not quite. We'll be sharing the same next of kin. . I'd go the whole wide world. I'd go the whole wide world. Just to find her. I'd go the whole wide world. I'd go the whole wide world. Find out where they hide her,happy.============aafb41307dcf472e2cda92001ed8d222.lyrics.txt
There was a little spanish flea. A record star he thought he'd be. He heard of singers like Beatles. And The Chipmunks he'd seen on TV. Why not a little spanish flea?. . And so he hid. Inside a doggie from madrid. He arrived in the city. Still singin his sweet harmony. As proud as any flea could be. . He walked around. As if he owned the town. Humming his pint sized melody. With his guitar he knew he'd be a star. And in his own home town "I'll help you if i can". He listened close to his song. And then he sang right along for you see. He loved that little spanish flea,happy.============d01a89d6dab206b451d2f0aae91fbaca.lyrics.txt

The rain it started tapping. On the window near my bed. There was a loophole in my dreaming. So I got out of it. And to my surprise my eyes were wide and already open. Just my nightstand and my dresser. Where those nightmares had just been. . So I dressed myself and left then . Out into the gray streets. But everything seemed different. And completely new to me. The sky the trees stranger . For your therapeutic smile. . So that's how I learned the lesson. That everyone's alone. And your eyes must do some raining. If you're ever gonna grow. And when crying don't help . You can't compose yourself. It's best to compose a poem. An honest verse of longing. Or a simple song of hope. . That's why I'm singing baby don't worry . 'Cause now I got your back. And every time you feel like crying. I'm gonna try and make you laugh. And if I can't . If it just hurts too bad. Then we'll wait for it to pass. And I will keep you company for those days so long and black. . And we'll keep working on the problem. We know we'll never solve. Of love's uneven remainders. Our lives are fractions of a whole. But if the world could remain within a frame. Like a painting on a wall. Then I think we'd see the beauty then. We'd stand staring in awe. . At our still lives posed . Like a bowl of oranges. Like a story told. By the fault-lines and the soil,happy.============d6336abc10a4190397bdd39f46c5a0da.lyrics.txt

If I made it through Christmas without smoking. 'Til your parents went to bed. If you made it through too. Without sticking your nail scissors in my neck. I'll buy you bras instead of pickled eggs.

Mysterioso displacement. Porportioned anti subtle bubble. Gun unarmed the torsos run but they. Cannot grasp the antelope hunter. Made his weapons out of sticks. Thinking drinking from the sun. Her moonbeams birth mercurial babies. Antelopes run free and the sea it returns me. . To all of the places that I have known. . Now that my body's grown the lonely heart poetry. Droning in hearts becomes songs that all objects. Sing to each other like friends telling stories. . It's all the same story. And Ed is a portal. . The immorals gently awaken. All possibilities open. Unto one another. And brothers and sisters begin. To see truly through strata,happy.============09482749385bd418edf059e3ca2fedd8.lyrics.txt

As the descent began I got the distinct impression. Lake Michigan had been frozen for decades. I conducted the warmth from my metronome sternum. To our massive jetting vessel billowing plumes of spent fuel. . The tundra under us cracked and ruptured. To reveal palisades. Made of blades of gray gray bristling grass. And papulose lichen. I was so frightened. As my grip on you tightened. Your skin got slicker. . I am a deserted bus depot. Though our approach suggested. An American hazy sea. Like the one I found inside. After driving you home once. Still half high. . I-90 through utter desolation. I sense evil at the heart of each far flung well lighted home. I close my eyes and see cellar stairways. Vermiculated with delicate animal bone. . Musty rooms house racks of fur jackets. Spattered with plasma. On a bus in Indiana. I called you and screamed. Under ceaseless patterns of weeping light,happy.============6689266087fd4026918282281653d575.lyrics.txt

20 years of schooling. I just never learned the math. That one and one don't equal two. They often equal half. . I have tried to live the high life. The best that I know how.

Cause the masquerade is over. But I was barely there. The mask come off the gilded cloth. Yet I'm just barely there. . I do believe that there's no more tricks up my sleeve.

A long stone and my day's all serpentine. The tired tarnish in my chest rests sense of SARS. And one dull dawn where they hum that splits its length. Does my name sting your tongue?  Now does it beg?. . Your thin frame has set my eyes to fray. On our dim stretch of this street how it aches. For every grey and sad and taut to coil. And our frail eyes and there watch to finally talk. . One brash phrase cut crush these fragile days. My thoughts swirl in some shrill sad cannonade. And one such spur that caused my throat to creak. The one dull dawn that I've since sensed to repeat,calm.============1496a7b94739818f1f1199ed457f0368.lyrics.txt

Andalucia when can I see you. When it is snowing out again. Farmer John wants you. Louder and softer closer and nearer. Then again. Needing you taking you keeping you leaving you. In a year and a day to be sure. That your face doesn't alter. Your words never falter -- I love you. . I'll be here waiting later and later. Hoping the night will go away. Andalucia Castles and Christians. Andalucia come to stay. You were lost on a day much like this. When you'd made up your mind not to come. And I couldn't persuade you. Or wait till tomorrow -- or pass the time,sad.============56534c095683e21dbaeaa52fad489e17.lyrics.txt
Anda my love. Wake up to your window . The day calls in billows . It's echoing moonlight onto the blue nightmare of your heart. In cosy red rainbow . It's shaking off halos . And the memory of our sacred so and so's. . Oh take my hand sweet . Complete your release. Unbury your feet . And married we'll be. Alone in receiving ours is a feeling. Not that they would see.

Pumping blood to the roots of evil to keep them young . . Ah me all mine. Is it safe to say that we've waited patiently . Call me on time . And recall the tune that has placed us gracefully . All into line . There's a garden grave and a place there saved for you . I fall by your side . Though your silver-haired mama throws told-you so's . . We're laying in the shadow of your family tree.

And now a road connects the cul-de-sac. To the adjacent development. But there used to be trees stretching back. And there was no way through. . And I was thankful for the mystery. But by the time that girl had hanged herself. I could have looked out my back window. And watched her neck just snap. . Baseball field lights that shine. Over the shedding pine. Each bulb's a blinding sphere. In the secular nation. Unhurried sirens moan. Pitches that glaze my eyes. She's just a pale fleshy typewriter-light advertisement for a wind chime that emits rays which resonate in the polluted sky. . All entrances to the. Merritt blocked off I mean. I'd love to believe that death's. Just the beginning as the. Shutters fly open and the. Breeze gives me pause.

Don't coax me. . Follow me to nowhere. Woven with the utmost care. . Have they cleansed you with chloride. And scrubbed behind the knees. Has your body been hollowed by the breeze,sexy.============78f71f4cc15cb3d3fe70942acedacc37.lyrics.txt

at night we crossed the border following a Black robe. to the edge of the reservation—to Cataldo Mission. where the saints and all the martyrs look down on dying converts. . . Yeah. It's my home—last night I dreamt that I grew wings. I found a place where they could hear me when I sing.. . and so they came with cameras—breaking through the morning mist. press and businessmen—tycoons—Episcopal philanthropists. lost in their appraisal of the body of a woman. but all we saw were lowlands—clouds clung to mountains without strings. . and at last we saw some people... . at last we saw some people.... at last we saw some people huddled up against. the rain that was descending like railroad spikes and hammers. they were headed for the border—walking and then running. and then they were gone into the fog but Anne said underneath their jackets she saw wings,calm.============8a88ba7ffd5217b66304345799fa884e.lyrics.txt

At the starting of the week. At summit talks you'll hear them speak. It's only Monday. Negotiations breaking down. See those leaders start to frown. It's sword and gun day. . Tomorrow never comes until it's too late. . You could be sitting taking lunch. The news will hit you like a punch. It's only Tuesday. You never thought we'd go to war. After all the things we saw. It's April Fools day. . Tomorrow never comes until it's too late. . We'll all go running underground. And we'll be listening for the sound. It's only Wednesday. In your shelter dimly lit. Take some wool and learn to knit. Cause it's a long day. . Tomorrow never comes until it's too late. . You hear a whistling overhead. Are you alive or are you dead?. It's only Thursday. You feel a shaking on the ground. A billion candles burn around. Is it your birthday?. . Tomorrow never comes until it's too late. . Although that shelter is your home. A living space you have outgrown. It's only Friday. As you come out to the light. Can your eyes behold the sight?. It must be doomsday. . Tomorrow never comes until it's too late. . Ain't it funny how men think. They made the bomb they are extinct. It's only Saturday. . I think tomorrow's come I think it's too late. I think tomorrow's come I think it's too late.

Baby canteen cause they think it's a masterpiece. . The sky has brakes . What a good day to rise. De Soto De Son will time. . Goodbye blue heron goodbye green fly goodbye goodbye. . I've got a raft you'll sail till the open lie in the lake. While your body is broken . When you go out I'll cry in the thicket. Shooting from school. There's a green where the crickets cry mom can't breathe and i know she's leaving. And that the birds of a quay are all good for the crocodile. So slow it down. Its not a race. Death takes time. Do you see it?. . Baby canteen swollen fingers in the water . I roped an Island pony for your birthday. I'll live in wooded housing till they put out all your needles. And drop you in and shelter near the highway,calm.============990a4ba58bf79183d789c741f357196c.lyrics.txt

Baby's into running around. Hanging with the crowd. Putting your business in the street talking out loud. Saying you bought her this and that. And how much you done spent. I swear she must believe it's all heaven sent. Hey boy you better bring the chick around. To the sad. sad truth the dirty lowdown. . (Who I wonder who) taught her how to talk like that. (Who I wonder who) gave her that big idea. . Nothing you can't handle nothing you ain't got. Put the money on the table and drive it off the lot. Turn on that ole lovelight and turn a maybe to a yes. Same old schoolboy game got you into this mess. Hey son better get back to town. Face the sad old truth the dirty lowdown. . (Who I wonder who) put those ideas in your head. (Who I wonder who) yeah. Come on back down little son. Dig the low low low low lowdown. . You ain't got to be so bad got to be so cold. This dog eat dog existence sure is getting old. Got to have a Jones for this Jones for that. This running with the Joneses boy. Just ain't where it's at. You gonna come back around. To the sad sad truth the dirty lowdown. . (Who I wonder who) got you thinking like that boy. (Who I wonder who). (Who I wonder who said who I wonder who). Oh look out for that lowdown. That dirty dirty dirty dirty lowdown.

Baby's on fire. Better throw her in the water. Look at her laughing. Like a heifer to the slaughter. . Baby's on fire. And all the laughing boys are bitching. Waiting for photos. Oh the plot is so bewitching. . Rescuers row row. Do your best to change the subject. Blow the wind blow blow. Lend some assistance to the object. . Photographers snip snap. Take your time she's only burning. This kind of experience. Is necessary for her learning. . If you'll be my flotsam. I could be half the man I used to. They said you were hot stuff. And that's what baby's been reduced to. . Juanita and Juan. Very clever with maracas. Making their fortunes. Selling secondhand tobaccoes. . Juan dances at Chico's. And when the clients are evicted. He empties the ashtrays. And pockets all that he's collected. . But baby's on fire. And all the instruments agree that. Her temperature's rising. But any idiot would know that,sexy.============1b2cebfef9dc31289b0cd7f98cc11f8b.lyrics.txt

Bailey's her name and there's a price she takes. . Blurring lines while she ruthlessly raised the stakes. . And there's a mess that she made. . We kiss on the mouth with hearts that were bound and gagged. . The news was broke the witness was the Cascades. . Do you remember me? . 'Cause there's a piece of my mind in a field of dandelions. . Do you remember me? 'Cause there's a tale I tell. . It's made of rain and hell. . We will seldom speak our bodies became arsonists to will and brains. . To him the cold hearted thing was she came demanding rings. . The day was mute and hot. We will rarely talk. . I'm just where you left me alone by them lilacs.,lonely.============931d7d74fe09b523cf82e3b75a2e0329.lyrics.txt

After driving you home once. Still half high. . I-90 through utter desolation. I sense evil at the heart of each far flung well lighted home. I close my eyes and see cellar stairways. Vermiculated with delicate animal bone. . Musty rooms house racks of fur jackets. Spattered with plasma. On a bus in Indiana. I called you and screamed. Under ceaseless patterns of weeping light,happy.============6689266087fd4026918282281653d575.lyrics.txt

If you'll be my star . I'll be your sky . You can hide underneath me and come out at night . When I turn jet black . And you show off your light . I live to let you shine .

You never hear me talk about one day getting out. Why put a new address on the same old loneliness. Everybody knows where that is. We built that house of his. And when he's not home. Someone else you know always is. If Heaven's really coming back. I hope it has a heart attack. When they see how dangerous it is for guys like that. The night has always known when it's time to get going. When it's really been so long that it starts showing. It's always had that ghost who always almost. Tells me the Secret. How there's really no difference in who he was once. And who he's become. Everything you hated me for… Honey there was so much more. I just didn't get busted.. But I'm not looking for an easy way out. This whole life it's been about. Try and try and try. And try and try and try. To be simple again,lonely.============d8d1a5373201f4fa9454d3b987d8dd5d.lyrics.txt

I am sitting in the morning. At the diner on the corner. I am waiting at the counter. For the man to pour the coffee. . And he fills it only halfway. And before I even argue. He is looking out the window. At somebody coming in. . "It is always nice to see you". Says the man behind the counter. To the woman who has come in. She is shaking her umbrella. .

Did I burn each last bit of myself. Did I turn my back on the kid in myself. And tear the oldest root. In a charlatan's pursuit. And the world difting farther away. . On the run with nowhere to hide. The black angel still clings to my side. You know he's faster than. Any man. And the world drifting further away. . What I told you lover I guess that I meant.

They ask to be preserved. . I was ashamed and mute. Fumbling around for my parachute. Then gliding through the rain. Not a drop could leave its stain. And the world drifting farther away,lonely.============acf6567d9e847a5ec40710b2444bf28a.lyrics.txt

I walk along the street. I look into your eyes. I'm pleasant when we meet. I'm there when you go home. How many times before. Could you tell I didn't care?. When you turned your back on me.

A cause we call our own. Beside an empty throne. How many times before. Could you tell I didn't care?. When you reached out in your sleep. And you knew I wasn't there. My eyes are made of stone. Just like your sordid home. How many times before,lonely.============7087c6d5b08d59402ad61558ac82f766.lyrics.txt

Wouldn't be nice if we were close. Or pretending that the war could kill the ghost. Maybe I could operate . But I'm done that's not breakin' news.

If I made it through Christmas without smoking. 'Til your parents went to bed. If you made it through too. Without sticking your nail scissors in my neck. I'll buy you bras instead of pickled eggs.

Saul Williams:. . Please Mr. Nichols come back inside the window. I can't promise you anything perched on the threshold of oblivion.. Countless man made stories above the truth. For so long you've stood facing the setting sun. Mistaking the complimentary unified duality of nature as being right or wrong. Good or evil. God or devil.

Note the energy swirling from its center. How it illumines us all and only the birds fly first class.... . There is your inheritance!. The warmth of a kiss. Invest your tongue into the mouth of mystery. Allow her breath to seep into your lungs and surrender to her touch and guidance. There's no other way. Your dreams of dominance will only help you forsake yourself. While your family continues its search for understanding. And your daughters outlive your sons...,lonely.============0c089985a189fd0c7837271ff27f6073.lyrics.txt

He walked down a busy street. Staring solely at his feet. Clutching pictures of past lovers at his side. Stood at the table where she sat. And removed his hat. In respect of her presence. Presents her with the pictures and says. "These are just ghosts that broke my heart before I met you.. These are just ghosts that broke my heart before I met you". . Opened up his little heart. Unlocked the lock that kept it dark. And read a written warning. Saying 'I'm still mourning. Over ghosts. Over ghosts. Over ghosts. Over ghosts that broke my heart before I met you'. .

20 years of schooling. I just never learned the math. That one and one don't equal two. They often equal half. . I have tried to live the high life. The best that I know how. And I bought my share of debonair. And parlayed it on the crowd. . I do believe that there's no more tricks up my sleeve. The good old days have past and the good times after that. And slowly I've become undone. A stranger with a stranger heart. . Well I plan to hit the bottom. The bottle then the top. And I pray that something quits me. Before I gotta stop. . Cause the masquerade is over. But I was barely there. The mask come off the gilded cloth. Yet I'm just barely there. . I do believe that there's no more tricks up my sleeve. The good old days have past and the good times after that. And slowly I've become undone. A stranger with a stranger heart,funny.============83ab59fb0ff015e651cf3cf50f83301b.lyrics.txt

All there years you've been speaking without breathing. Spinning closer to the sun. Had your way with an unsuspecting public. Little threads are all it takes. La la la la ....

Sometimes I could just choke myself with laughter. Sometimes everything's so true. So when you come down from your death-defying labors. I'll still be in love with you.

A long stone and my day's all serpentine. The tired tarnish in my chest rests sense of SARS. And one dull dawn where they hum that splits its length. Does my name sting your tongue?  Now does it beg?. . Your thin frame has set my eyes to fray. On our dim stretch of this street how it aches. For every grey and sad and taut to coil. And our frail eyes and there watch to finally talk. . One brash phrase cut crush these fragile days. My thoughts swirl in some shrill sad cannonade. And one such spur that caused my throat to creak. The one dull dawn that I've since sensed to repeat,calm.============1496a7b94739818f1f1199ed457f0368.lyrics.txt

Andalucia when can I see you. When it is snowing out again. Farmer John wants you. Louder and softer closer and nearer. Then again. Needing you taking you keeping you leaving you. In a year and a day to be sure. That your face doesn't alter. Your words never falter -- I love you. . I'll be here waiting later and later. Hoping the night will go away. Andalucia Castles and Christians. Andalucia come to stay. You were lost on a day much like this. When you'd made up your mind not to come. And I couldn't persuade you. Or wait till tomorrow -- or pass the time,sad.============56534c095683e21dbaeaa52fad489e17.lyrics.txt
Anda my love. Wake up to your window . The day calls in billows . It's echoing moonlight onto the blue nightmare of your heart. In cosy red rainbow . It's shaking off halos . And the memory of our sacred so and so's. . Oh take my hand sweet . Complete your release. Unbury your feet . And married we'll be. Alone in receiving ours is a feeling. Not that they would see. They don't know that we could be . Down where your cradle escaped the sea . And your raven-haired mama caught told you so's. . We're laying in the shadow of your family tree . Your haunted heart and me. Brought down by an old idea whose time has come . And in the shadow of the gallows of your family tree . There's a hundred hearts or three. Pumping blood to the roots of evil to keep them young . . Ah me all mine. Is it safe to say that we've waited patiently . Call me on time . And recall the tune that has placed us gracefully . All into line . There's a garden grave and a place there saved for you . I fall by your side . Though your silver-haired mama throws told-you so's . . We're laying in the shadow of your family tree.

And now a road connects the cul-de-sac. To the adjacent development. But there used to be trees stretching back. And there was no way through. . And I was thankful for the mystery. But by the time that girl had hanged herself. I could have looked out my back window. And watched her neck just snap. . Baseball field lights that shine. Over the shedding pine. Each bulb's a blinding sphere. In the secular nation. Unhurried sirens moan. Pitches that glaze my eyes. She's just a pale fleshy typewriter-light advertisement for a wind chime that emits rays which resonate in the polluted sky. . All entrances to the. Merritt blocked off I mean. I'd love to believe that death's. Just the beginning as the. Shutters fly open and the. Breeze gives me pause. I know what's out there. morning phone calls silence and resentment and craters a new moon built in a line,energetic.============597e4650f587aa08e7a57b2a9fab97e5.lyrics.txt

at night we crossed the border following a Black robe. to the edge of the reservation—to Cataldo Mission. where the saints and all the martyrs look down on dying converts. . . Yeah. It's my home—last night I dreamt that I grew wings. I found a place where they could hear me when I sing.. . and so they came with cameras—breaking through the morning mist. press and businessmen—tycoons—Episcopal philanthropists. lost in their appraisal of the body of a woman. but all we saw were lowlands—clouds clung to mountains without strings. . and at last we saw some people... . at last we saw some people.... at last we saw some people huddled up against. the rain that was descending like railroad spikes and hammers. they were headed for the border—walking and then running. and then they were gone into the fog but Anne said underneath their jackets she saw wings,calm.============8a88ba7ffd5217b66304345799fa884e.lyrics.txt

At the starting of the week. At summit talks you'll hear them speak. It's only Monday. Negotiations breaking down. See those leaders start to frown. It's sword and gun day. . Tomorrow never comes until it's too late. . You could be sitting taking lunch. The news will hit you like a punch. It's only Tuesday. You never thought we'd go to war. After all the things we saw. It's April Fools day. . Tomorrow never comes until it's too late. . We'll all go running underground. And we'll be listening for the sound. It's only Wednesday. In your shelter dimly lit. Take some wool and learn to knit. Cause it's a long day. . Tomorrow never comes until it's too late. . You hear a whistling overhead. Are you alive or are you dead?. It's only Thursday. You feel a shaking on the ground. A billion candles burn around. Is it your birthday?. . Tomorrow never comes until it's too late. . Although that shelter is your home. A living space you have outgrown. It's only Friday. As you come out to the light. Can your eyes behold the sight?. It must be doomsday. . Tomorrow never comes until it's too late. . Ain't it funny how men think. They made the bomb they are extinct. It's only Saturday. . I think tomorrow's come I think it's too late. I think tomorrow's come I think it's too late. Think tomorrow's come I think it's too late,high.============393d61c83f06b9fefa6ab70659a2d6c6.lyrics.txt

Baby canteen cause they think it's a masterpiece. . The sky has brakes . What a good day to rise. De Soto De Son will time. . Goodbye blue heron goodbye green fly goodbye goodbye. . I've got a raft you'll sail till the open lie in the lake. While your body is broken . When you go out I'll cry in the thicket. Shooting from school. There's a green where the crickets cry mom can't breathe and i know she's leaving. And that the birds of a quay are all good for the crocodile. So slow it down. Its not a race. Death takes time. Do you see it?. . Baby canteen swollen fingers in the water . I roped an Island pony for your birthday. I'll live in wooded housing till they put out all your needles. And drop you in and shelter near the highway,calm.============990a4ba58bf79183d789c741f357196c.lyrics.txt

Baby's into running around. Hanging with the crowd. Putting your business in the street talking out loud. Saying you bought her this and that. And how much you done spent. I swear she must believe it's all heaven sent. Hey boy you better bring the chick around. To the sad. sad truth the dirty lowdown. . (Who I wonder who) taught her how to talk like that. (Who I wonder who) gave her that big idea. . Nothing you can't handle nothing you ain't got. Put the money on the table and drive it off the lot. Turn on that ole lovelight and turn a maybe to a yes. Same old schoolboy game got you into this mess. Hey son better get back to town. Face the sad old truth the dirty lowdown. . (Who I wonder who) put those ideas in your head. (Who I wonder who) yeah. Come on back down little son. Dig the low low low low lowdown. . You ain't got to be so bad got to be so cold. This dog eat dog existence sure is getting old. Got to have a Jones for this Jones for that. This running with the Joneses boy. Just ain't where it's at. You gonna come back around. To the sad sad truth the dirty lowdown. .

After driving you home once. Still half high. . I-90 through utter desolation. I sense evil at the heart of each far flung well lighted home. I close my eyes and see cellar stairways. Vermiculated with delicate animal bone. . Musty rooms house racks of fur jackets. Spattered with plasma. On a bus in Indiana. I called you and screamed. Under ceaseless patterns of weeping light,happy.============6689266087fd4026918282281653d575.lyrics.txt

20 years of schooling. I just never learned the math. That one and one don't equal two. They often equal half. . I have tried to live the high life. The best that I know how. And I bought my share of debonair. And parlayed it on the crowd. . I do believe that there's no more tricks up my sleeve. The good old days have past and the good times after that. And slowly I've become undone. A stranger with a stranger heart. . Well I plan to hit the bottom. The bottle then the top. And I pray that something quits me. Before I gotta stop. . Cause the masquerade is over. But I was barely there. The mask come off the gilded cloth. Yet I'm just barely there. . I do believe that there's no more tricks up my sleeve. The good old days have past and the good times after that. And slowly I've become undone. A stranger with a stranger heart,funny.============83ab59fb0ff015e651cf3cf50f83301b.lyrics.txt

A long stone and my day's all serpentine. The tired tarnish in my chest rests sense of SARS. And one dull dawn where they hum that splits its length. Does my name sting your tongue?  Now does it beg?. . Your thin frame has set my eyes to fray. On our dim stretch of this street how it aches. For every grey and sad and taut to coil. And our frail eyes and there watch to finally talk. . One brash phrase cut crush these fragile days. My thoughts swirl in some shrill sad cannonade. And one such spur that caused my throat to creak. The one dull dawn that I've since sensed to repeat,calm.============1496a7b94739818f1f1199ed457f0368.lyrics.txt
A long time you waited. You thought it had abated. Shame of it all. The harm that it causes. Pours down like a faucet. Shame of it all,calm.============cf3af61e9a9d4210e39c6217076c97c3.lyrics.txt

Alors tu vois comme tout se mêle. Et du cœur à tes lèvres je deviens un casse-tête. Ton rire me crie de te lâcher. Avant de perdre prise et d'abandonner. . Car je ne t'en demanderai jamais autant.

Andalucia when can I see you. When it is snowing out again. Farmer John wants you. Louder and softer closer and nearer. Then again. Needing you taking you keeping you leaving you. In a year and a day to be sure. That your face doesn't alter. Your words never falter -- I love you. . I'll be here waiting later and later. Hoping the night will go away. Andalucia Castles and Christians. Andalucia come to stay. You were lost on a day much like this. When you'd made up your mind not to come. And I couldn't persuade you.

Anda my love. Wake up to your window . The day calls in billows . It's echoing moonlight onto the blue nightmare of your heart. In cosy red rainbow . It's shaking off halos . And the memory of our sacred so and so's. . Oh take my hand sweet . Complete your release. Unbury your feet . And married we'll be. Alone in receiving ours is a feeling. Not that they would see. They don't know that we could be . Down where your cradle escaped the sea . And your raven-haired mama caught told you so's. . We're laying in the shadow of your family tree . Your haunted heart and me. Brought down by an old idea whose time has come . And in the shadow of the gallows of your family tree . There's a hundred hearts or three. Pumping blood to the roots of evil to keep them young . . Ah me all mine. Is it safe to say that we've waited patiently . Call me on time . And recall the tune that has placed us gracefully . All into line . There's a garden grave and a place there saved for you . I fall by your side . Though your silver-haired mama throws told-you so's . . We're laying in the shadow of your family tree. Your haunted heart and me. Brought down by an old idea whose time has come. And in the shadow of the gallows of your family tree. There's a hundred hearts or three.

And now a road connects the cul-de-sac. To the adjacent development. But there used to be trees stretching back. And there was no way through. . And I was thankful for the mystery. But by the time that girl had hanged herself. I could have looked out my back window. And watched her neck just snap. . Baseball field lights that shine. Over the shedding pine. Each bulb's a blinding sphere. In the secular nation. Unhurried sirens moan. Pitches that glaze my eyes. She's just a pale fleshy typewriter-light advertisement for a wind chime that emits rays which resonate in the polluted sky. . All entrances to the. Merritt blocked off I mean. I'd love to believe that death's. Just the beginning as the. Shutters fly open and the. Breeze gives me pause. I know what's out there. morning phone calls silence and resentment and craters a new moon built in a line,energetic.============597e4650f587aa08e7a57b2a9fab97e5.lyrics.txt

So real these voices in my head. When it comes back you won't be. Scared and lonely. You won't be scared you won't be. You won't be scared and lonely. You won't be scared you won't be lonely. . Its all because of you. I wish you never told me. I wake up screaming now. So real these voices in my head. So real these voices in my head. I wake up screaming now. I wish you never told me. I wish I never knew. . Scared and lonely. You won't be scared you won't be. You won't be scared and lonely. You won't be scared you won't be lonely. . Scared and lonely. You won't be scared you won't be. You won't be scared and lonely. You won't be scared you won't be lonely,angry.============3b85f69362898d1f65f9d15741389eb8.lyrics.txt
at night we crossed the border following a Black robe. to the edge of the reservation—to Cataldo Mission. where the saints and all the martyrs look down on dying converts. . . Yeah. It's my home—last night I dreamt that I grew wings. I found a place where they could hear me when I sing.. . and so they came with cameras—breaking through the morning mist. press and businessmen—tycoons—Episcopal philanthropists. lost in their appraisal of the body of a woman. but all we saw were lowlands—clouds clung to mountains without strings. . and at last we saw some people... . at last we saw some people.... at last we saw some people huddled up against. the rain that was descending like railroad spikes and hammers. they were headed for the border—walking and then running. and then they were gone into the fog but Anne said underneath their jackets she saw wings,calm.============8a88ba7ffd5217b66304345799fa884e.lyrics.txt

At the starting of the week. At summit talks you'll hear them speak. It's only Monday. Negotiations breaking down. See those leaders start to frown. It's sword and gun day. . Tomorrow never comes until it's too late. . You could be sitting taking lunch. The news will hit you like a punch. It's only Tuesday. You never thought we'd go to war. After all the things we saw. It's April Fools day. . Tomorrow never comes until it's too late. . We'll all go running underground. And we'll be listening for the sound. It's only Wednesday. In your shelter dimly lit. Take some wool and learn to knit. Cause it's a long day. . Tomorrow never comes until it's too late. . You hear a whistling overhead. Are you alive or are you dead?. It's only Thursday. You feel a shaking on the ground. A billion candles burn around. Is it your birthday?. . Tomorrow never comes until it's too late. . Although that shelter is your home. A living space you have outgrown. It's only Friday. As you come out to the light. Can your eyes behold the sight?. It must be doomsday. . Tomorrow never comes until it's too late. . Ain't it funny how men think. They made the bomb they are extinct. It's only Saturday. . I think tomorrow's come I think it's too late. I think tomorrow's come I think it's too late. Think tomorrow's come I think it's too late,high.============393d61c83f06b9fefa6ab70659a2d6c6.lyrics.txt

Baby canteen cause they think it's a masterpiece. . The sky has brakes . What a good day to rise. De Soto De Son will time. . Goodbye blue heron goodbye green fly goodbye goodbye. . I've got a raft you'll sail till the open lie in the lake. While your body is broken . When you go out I'll cry in the thicket. Shooting from school. There's a green where the crickets cry mom can't breathe and i know she's leaving. And that the birds of a quay are all good for the crocodile. So slow it down. Its not a race. Death takes time. Do you see it?. . Baby canteen swollen fingers in the water . I roped an Island pony for your birthday. I'll live in wooded housing till they put out all your needles. And drop you in and shelter near the highway,calm.============990a4ba58bf79183d789c741f357196c.lyrics.txt

Baby's into running around. Hanging with the crowd. Putting your business in the street talking out loud. Saying you bought her this and that. And how much you done spent. I swear she must believe it's all heaven sent. Hey boy you better bring the chick around. To the sad. sad truth the dirty lowdown. . (Who I wonder who) taught her how to talk like that. (Who I wonder who) gave her that big idea. . Nothing you can't handle nothing you ain't got. Put the money on the table and drive it off the lot. Turn on that ole lovelight and turn a maybe to a yes. Same old schoolboy game got you into this mess. Hey son better get back to town. Face the sad old truth the dirty lowdown. . (Who I wonder who) put those ideas in your head. (Who I wonder who) yeah. Come on back down little son. Dig the low low low low lowdown. . You ain't got to be so bad got to be so cold. This dog eat dog existence sure is getting old. Got to have a Jones for this Jones for that. This running with the Joneses boy. Just ain't where it's at. You gonna come back around. To the sad sad truth the dirty lowdown. . (Who I wonder who) got you thinking like that boy. (Who I wonder who). (Who I wonder who said who I wonder who). Oh look out for that lowdown. That dirty dirty dirty dirty lowdown. (Who I wonder who ohh ohh). Got you thinking like that,groovy.============0fd65e99a3eb3085a04598b217defda4.lyrics.txt
Baby's on fire. Better throw her in the water. Look at her laughing. Like a heifer to the slaughter. . Baby's on fire. And all the laughing boys are bitching. Waiting for photos. Oh the plot is so bewitching. . Rescuers row row. Do your best to change the subject. Blow the wind blow blow. Lend some assistance to the object. . Photographers snip snap. Take your time she's only burning. This kind of experience. Is necessary for her learning. . If you'll be my flotsam. I could be half the man I used to. They said you were hot stuff. And that's what baby's been reduced to. . Juanita and Juan. Very clever with maracas. Making their fortunes. Selling secondhand tobaccoes. . Juan dances at Chico's. And when the clients are evicted. He empties the ashtrays. And pockets all that he's collected. . But baby's on fire. And all the instruments agree that. Her temperature's rising. But any idiot would know that,happy.============1b2cebfef9dc31289b0cd7f98cc11f8b.lyrics.txt

Bailey's her name and there's a price she takes. . Blurring lines while she ruthlessly raised the stakes. . And there's a mess that she made. . We kiss on the mouth with hearts that were bound and gagged. . The news was broke the witness was the Cascades. . Do you remember me? . 'Cause there's a piece of my mind in a field of dandelions. . Do you remember me? 'Cause there's a tale I tell. . It's made of rain and hell. . We will seldom speak our bodies became arsonists to will and brains. . To him the cold hearted thing was she came demanding rings. . The day was mute and hot. We will rarely talk. . I'm just where you left me alone by them lilacs.,lonely.============931d7d74fe09b523cf82e3b75a2e0329.lyrics.txt

Before the world you know was like it is. I held a lover once and I was his. And we walked along the river in the sun. But he's a lonely man so this was done. The only place we had to meet was night.

And in the endless sky we are but one. We are alive. In my dreams wolf and I. . How many days and nights will come and go. While the only light you'll see is from my glow. There will never be a dawn that breaks the spell surrounding us. . Til the earth dies with the sun. . And you are the wolf . And I am the moon. And in the endless sky we are but one. We are alive.

As the descent began I got the distinct impression. Lake Michigan had been frozen for decades. I conducted the warmth from my metronome sternum. To our massive jetting vessel billowing plumes of spent fuel. . The tundra under us cracked and ruptured. To reveal palisades. Made of blades of gray gray bristling grass. And papulose lichen. I was so frightened. As my grip on you tightened. Your skin got slicker. . I am a deserted bus depot. Though our approach suggested. An American hazy sea. Like the one I found inside. After driving you home once. Still half high. . I-90 through utter desolation. I sense evil at the heart of each far flung well lighted home. I close my eyes and see cellar stairways. Vermiculated with delicate animal bone. . Musty rooms house racks of fur jackets. Spattered with plasma. On a bus in Indiana. I called you and screamed. Under ceaseless patterns of weeping light,happy.============6689266087fd4026918282281653d575.lyrics.txt

The sky is dark. The wind is cold. The night is young. Before it's old and grey. We will know. The trill of it all. The time has come. It's getting late. It's now or never. Don't hesitate or stall. When I call. Don't spoil. The thrill of it all. And before you go to sleep at night. Preying shadows - do they ask you why?. And in the morning through the afternoon. Do you wonder where you're going to?. Every word I use. Each crumpled page. Strange ideas. Mature with age. Like leaves. When autumn falls. Turn gold. Then they hit the ground. Every time I hear. The latest sound. It's pure whiskey. Reeling round and around. My brain. Oh and all o' that jive. It's driving me wild -. The dizzy spin I'm in. Everywhere I look. I see your face. I hear your name. It's all over the place. Hey girl. Though you've gone. Still I recall. The trill of it all. You might as well know what is right for you. And make the most of what you like to do. For all the pleasure that's surrounding you. Should compensate for all you're going through. So if you're feeling fraught. With mental strain. Too much thinking's got you down again. Well let your senses skip. Stay hip. Keep cool. To the thrill of it all. When you try too much. You lose control. Pressure rises. And so I'm told. Something's got the give. Oy Veh. High life ecstasy. You might as well live. I can't see. I can't speak. I couldn't take more than another week. Without you - oh no. So I will drink my fill. Till the trill is you. Oh the thrill of it all. Oh the thrill of it all. No I won't forget. The thrill of it all. No no no no no no no....,energetic.============d5e687bc3f4c3d440533b1155f5b2a4a.lyrics.txt

Solå står I zenith og håve henge lågt. I Gruvene på 16 er me I samme båt. Ved foten av fjellet kan du sjå me går. I takt med lenker rundt halsen år etter år. . Alt me fire ner I sjaktå av gull og grøn smaragd. Havne rett I fanget på Henry blir det sagt. Det dryppe ikkje på oss. Me trenge ingen potter. For Henry er ikkje prest og ingen av oss er klokker. . Sjøl ikkje Gud kan hørra oss når me ber I frå Helvete. . Ivan la på sprang men kom aldri tilbake. Mange før han har prøvd å ta Henry av dage. Og ryktet fortelle at han som står med pisken. Er rake motsetningen av en viss kristen. . I Gruvene på 16 har me budd I fire år. Men så snart sjangsen byr seg slår eg meg ut,energetic.============a23e8ad8d565b2f51dd5880067fc1702.lyrics.txt

Ed is a portal. Ed is a portal. And damned if we don't try. . To sort of relinquish the reigns our. Brains their mass has gravity. Pulls us into and away from. Portals such as Fractal Ed's. Mysterioso displacement. Porportioned anti subtle bubble. Gun unarmed the torsos run but they. Cannot grasp the antelope hunter. Made his weapons out of sticks. Thinking drinking from the sun. Her moonbeams birth mercurial babies. Antelopes run free and the sea it returns me. . To all of the places that I have known. . Now that my body's grown the lonely heart poetry. Droning in hearts becomes songs that all objects. Sing to each other like friends telling stories. . It's all the same story. And Ed is a portal. . The immorals gently awaken. All possibilities open. Unto one another. And brothers and sisters begin. To see truly through strata,energetic.============09482749385bd418edf059e3ca2fedd8.lyrics.txt
Stop the bus. I wanna be lonely. When seconds pass slowly. And years go flying by. You gotta stop the bus. I'll get off here. Enough's enough. And I'm leaving this factory. . All she wants. Is food on the table. I won't be able. To bring it home. No I won't Whoa. . It's 4 in the morning. Mother don't know. That I'm going far away. She's whispering to the moon. I hope he don't join you soon. . Baby boss. Climbs up on his soapbox. But Great Caesar's ghost. Knows what's best for me. He says stop the bus. . Did Mother Nature tell you. Boy you come and go as you please. That's what she said to me. Big brother got the keys. And I got Jackson Cannery. Big brother got the keys. And I got Jackson Cannery. Big brother got the keys.

A long stone and my day's all serpentine. The tired tarnish in my chest rests sense of SARS. And one dull dawn where they hum that splits its length. Does my name sting your tongue?  Now does it beg?. . Your thin frame has set my eyes to fray. On our dim stretch of this street how it aches. For every grey and sad and taut to coil. And our frail eyes and there watch to finally talk. . One brash phrase cut crush these fragile days. My thoughts swirl in some shrill sad cannonade. And one such spur that caused my throat to creak. The one dull dawn that I've since sensed to repeat,calm.============1496a7b94739818f1f1199ed457f0368.lyrics.txt

Andalucia when can I see you. When it is snowing out again. Farmer John wants you. Louder and softer closer and nearer. Then again. Needing you taking you keeping you leaving you. In a year and a day to be sure. That your face doesn't alter. Your words never falter -- I love you. . I'll be here waiting later and later. Hoping the night will go away. Andalucia Castles and Christians. Andalucia come to stay. You were lost on a day much like this. When you'd made up your mind not to come. And I couldn't persuade you. Or wait till tomorrow -- or pass the time,sad.============56534c095683e21dbaeaa52fad489e17.lyrics.txt
Anda my love. Wake up to your window . The day calls in billows . It's echoing moonlight onto the blue nightmare of your heart. In cosy red rainbow . It's shaking off halos . And the memory of our sacred so and so's. . Oh take my hand sweet . Complete your release. Unbury your feet . And married we'll be. Alone in receiving ours is a feeling. Not that they would see. They don't know that we could be . Down where your cradle escaped the sea . And your raven-haired mama caught told you so's. . We're laying in the shadow of your family tree . Your haunted heart and me. Brought down by an old idea whose time has come . And in the shadow of the gallows of your family tree . There's a hundred hearts or three. Pumping blood to the roots of evil to keep them young . . Ah me all mine. Is it safe to say that we've waited patiently . Call me on time . And recall the tune that has placed us gracefully . All into line . There's a garden grave and a place there saved for you . I fall by your side . Though your silver-haired mama throws told-you so's . . We're laying in the shadow of your family tree. Your haunted heart and me. Brought down by an old idea whose time has come. And in the shadow of the gallows of your family tree. There's a hundred hearts or three.

As we fall into sequence. And we're eating our young. Remain silent and still for modesty. . When the splints have been broken. And they can't help you now. Do you pray with your eyes closed naturally. . Follow me to nowhere. Woven with the utmost care. . If I'm lost please don't find me. If I drown let me sink. We descended from no one. With a wink. . When it's cold outside hold me. Don't hold me. When I choose to rest my eyes coax me. Don't coax me. When it's cold outside hold me. Don't hold me. When I choose to rest my eyes coax me. Don't coax me. . Follow me to nowhere. Woven with the utmost care. . Have they cleansed you with chloride. And scrubbed behind the knees. Has your body been hollowed by the breeze,high.============222883e45e0116ca66e3b57bb26c75ae.lyrics.txt

at night we crossed the border following a Black robe. to the edge of the reservation—to Cataldo Mission. where the saints and all the martyrs look down on dying converts. . . Yeah. It's my home—last night I dreamt that I grew wings. I found a place where they could hear me when I sing.. . and so they came with cameras—breaking through the morning mist. press and businessmen—tycoons—Episcopal philanthropists. lost in their appraisal of the body of a woman. but all we saw were lowlands—clouds clung to mountains without strings. . and at last we saw some people... . at last we saw some people.... at last we saw some people huddled up against. the rain that was descending like railroad spikes and hammers. they were headed for the border—walking and then running. and then they were gone into the fog but Anne said underneath their jackets she saw wings,calm.============8a88ba7ffd5217b66304345799fa884e.lyrics.txt

At the starting of the week. At summit talks you'll hear them speak. It's only Monday. Negotiations breaking down. See those leaders start to frown. It's sword and gun day. . Tomorrow never comes until it's too late. . You could be sitting taking lunch. The news will hit you like a punch. It's only Tuesday. You never thought we'd go to war. After all the things we saw. It's April Fools day. . Tomorrow never comes until it's too late. . We'll all go running underground. And we'll be listening for the sound. It's only Wednesday. In your shelter dimly lit. Take some wool and learn to knit. Cause it's a long day. . Tomorrow never comes until it's too late. . You hear a whistling overhead. Are you alive or are you dead?. It's only Thursday. You feel a shaking on the ground. A billion candles burn around. Is it your birthday?. . Tomorrow never comes until it's too late. . Although that shelter is your home. A living space you have outgrown. It's only Friday. As you come out to the light. Can your eyes behold the sight?. It must be doomsday. . Tomorrow never comes until it's too late. . Ain't it funny how men think. They made the bomb they are extinct. It's only Saturday. . I think tomorrow's come I think it's too late. I think tomorrow's come I think it's too late.

Baby canteen cause they think it's a masterpiece. . The sky has brakes . What a good day to rise. De Soto De Son will time. . Goodbye blue heron goodbye green fly goodbye goodbye. . I've got a raft you'll sail till the open lie in the lake. While your body is broken . When you go out I'll cry in the thicket. Shooting from school. There's a green where the crickets cry mom can't breathe and i know she's leaving. And that the birds of a quay are all good for the crocodile. So slow it down. Its not a race. Death takes time. Do you see it?. . Baby canteen swollen fingers in the water . I roped an Island pony for your birthday. I'll live in wooded housing till they put out all your needles. And drop you in and shelter near the highway,calm.============990a4ba58bf79183d789c741f357196c.lyrics.txt

Baby's into running around. Hanging with the crowd. Putting your business in the street talking out loud. Saying you bought her this and that. And how much you done spent. I swear she must believe it's all heaven sent. Hey boy you better bring the chick around. To the sad. sad truth the dirty lowdown. . (Who I wonder who) taught her how to talk like that. (Who I wonder who) gave her that big idea. . Nothing you can't handle nothing you ain't got. Put the money on the table and drive it off the lot. Turn on that ole lovelight and turn a maybe to a yes. Same old schoolboy game got you into this mess. Hey son better get back to town. Face the sad old truth the dirty lowdown. . (Who I wonder who) put those ideas in your head. (Who I wonder who) yeah. Come on back down little son. Dig the low low low low lowdown. . You ain't got to be so bad got to be so cold. This dog eat dog existence sure is getting old. Got to have a Jones for this Jones for that. This running with the Joneses boy. Just ain't where it's at. You gonna come back around. To the sad sad truth the dirty lowdown. . (Who I wonder who) got you thinking like that boy. (Who I wonder who). (Who I wonder who said who I wonder who). Oh look out for that lowdown. That dirty dirty dirty dirty lowdown.

Bailey's her name and there's a price she takes. . Blurring lines while she ruthlessly raised the stakes. . And there's a mess that she made. . We kiss on the mouth with hearts that were bound and gagged. . The news was broke the witness was the Cascades. . Do you remember me? . 'Cause there's a piece of my mind in a field of dandelions. . Do you remember me? 'Cause there's a tale I tell. . It's made of rain and hell. . We will seldom speak our bodies became arsonists to will and brains. . To him the cold hearted thing was she came demanding rings. . The day was mute and hot. We will rarely talk. . I'm just where you left me alone by them lilacs.,lonely.============931d7d74fe09b523cf82e3b75a2e0329.lyrics.txt

Vermiculated with delicate animal bone. . Musty rooms house racks of fur jackets. Spattered with plasma. On a bus in Indiana. I called you and screamed. Under ceaseless patterns of weeping light,happy.============6689266087fd4026918282281653d575.lyrics.txt

And our frail eyes and there watch to finally talk. . One brash phrase cut crush these fragile days. My thoughts swirl in some shrill sad cannonade. And one such spur that caused my throat to creak. The one dull dawn that I've since sensed to repeat,calm.============1496a7b94739818f1f1199ed457f0368.lyrics.txt

Anda my love. Wake up to your window . The day calls in billows . It's echoing moonlight onto the blue nightmare of your heart. In cosy red rainbow . It's shaking off halos . And the memory of our sacred so and so's. . Oh take my hand sweet . Complete your release. Unbury your feet . And married we'll be. Alone in receiving ours is a feeling. Not that they would see.

Pumping blood to the roots of evil to keep them young . . Ah me all mine. Is it safe to say that we've waited patiently . Call me on time . And recall the tune that has placed us gracefully . All into line . There's a garden grave and a place there saved for you . I fall by your side . Though your silver-haired mama throws told-you so's . . We're laying in the shadow of your family tree.

Wake stretch and move. Here comes another grey day. Wonder how late it is. Seems like there's no time for anything. What are you waiting for. Get your ass out the front door. Spend too much time. Trying to stay busy. Working and worrying. Planning to do something different. My friend mary says. Don't freak out about it. There's plenty of time. There's a coffin being built in the backyard. The sun came out today. Don't know how much time we've got left. But life seems empty so we fill it. With to-do lists. Drug and road trips. Singers singing about the same old shit. And when that's just not enough. Pry open the lid. I'm climbing in. But we keep on singing. Nail if fucking shut. I'm not getting in,angry.============abfe7464cf37030ea6f01113b7ceaa8a.lyrics.txt

Ed is a portal. Ed is a portal. And damned if we don't try. . To sort of relinquish the reigns our. Brains their mass has gravity. Pulls us into and away from. Portals such as Fractal Ed's. Mysterioso displacement. Porportioned anti subtle bubble. Gun unarmed the torsos run but they. Cannot grasp the antelope hunter. Made his weapons out of sticks. Thinking drinking from the sun. Her moonbeams birth mercurial babies. Antelopes run free and the sea it returns me. . To all of the places that I have known. . Now that my body's grown the lonely heart poetry. Droning in hearts becomes songs that all objects. Sing to each other like friends telling stories. . It's all the same story. And Ed is a portal. . The immorals gently awaken. All possibilities open. Unto one another. And brothers and sisters begin. To see truly through strata,angry.============09482749385bd418edf059e3ca2fedd8.lyrics.txt

A hundred days have made me older . Since the last time that I saw your pretty face . A thousand lies have made me colder. And I don't think I can look at this the same .

I have learned all your secrets so familiar. I know where you lay your head. Fear of god and a disappointing father. Holds the hand around your neck. La la la la .... Sometimes I could just choke myself with laughter. Sometimes everything's so true. So when you come down from your death-defying labors. I'll still be in love with you. La la la la ...,calm.============e9660854a3e93c4456790ce21ad89938.lyrics.txt

A long stone and my day's all serpentine. The tired tarnish in my chest rests sense of SARS. And one dull dawn where they hum that splits its length. Does my name sting your tongue?  Now does it beg?. . Your thin frame has set my eyes to fray. On our dim stretch of this street how it aches. For every grey and sad and taut to coil. And our frail eyes and there watch to finally talk. . One brash phrase cut crush these fragile days. My thoughts swirl in some shrill sad cannonade. And one such spur that caused my throat to creak. The one dull dawn that I've since sensed to repeat,calm.============1496a7b94739818f1f1199ed457f0368.lyrics.txt

Andalucia when can I see you. When it is snowing out again. Farmer John wants you. Louder and softer closer and nearer. Then again. Needing you taking you keeping you leaving you. In a year and a day to be sure. That your face doesn't alter. Your words never falter -- I love you. . I'll be here waiting later and later. Hoping the night will go away. Andalucia Castles and Christians. Andalucia come to stay. You were lost on a day much like this. When you'd made up your mind not to come. And I couldn't persuade you. Or wait till tomorrow -- or pass the time,sad.============56534c095683e21dbaeaa52fad489e17.lyrics.txt
Anda my love. Wake up to your window . The day calls in billows . It's echoing moonlight onto the blue nightmare of your heart. In cosy red rainbow . It's shaking off halos . And the memory of our sacred so and so's. . Oh take my hand sweet . Complete your release. Unbury your feet . And married we'll be. Alone in receiving ours is a feeling. Not that they would see. They don't know that we could be . Down where your cradle escaped the sea . And your raven-haired mama caught told you so's. . We're laying in the shadow of your family tree . Your haunted heart and me. Brought down by an old idea whose time has come . And in the shadow of the gallows of your family tree . There's a hundred hearts or three. Pumping blood to the roots of evil to keep them young . . Ah me all mine. Is it safe to say that we've waited patiently . Call me on time . And recall the tune that has placed us gracefully . All into line . There's a garden grave and a place there saved for you . I fall by your side . Though your silver-haired mama throws told-you so's . . We're laying in the shadow of your family tree.

A hundred days have made me older . Since the last time that I saw your pretty face . A thousand lies have made me colder. And I don't think I can look at this the same . But all the miles that separate . They disappear now when I'm dreaming of your face . . I'm here without you baby . But you're still on my lonely mind . I think about you baby . And I dream about you all the time . I'm here without you baby . And you're still with me in my dreams . And tonight it's only you and me yeah. . The miles just keep rollin'.

And I found myself attached to this railroad track. But I'll come back to you some day. To you. To you. To you. Some day. . Maybe I should just turn around. Walk away. For no matter how much I really do want to stay. You know I can when it's too late. . Oh I've found myself attached to this railroad track. I'll come back to you some day. To you. To you. To you. Some day,sad.============8f089ac871b9844419584b37b6d6319f.lyrics.txt

All there years you've been speaking without breathing. Spinning closer to the sun. Had your way with an unsuspecting public. Little threads are all it takes. La la la la .... I have learned all your secrets so familiar. I know where you lay your head. Fear of god and a disappointing father. Holds the hand around your neck. La la la la .... Sometimes I could just choke myself with laughter. Sometimes everything's so true. So when you come down from your death-defying labors. I'll still be in love with you. La la la la ...,calm.============e9660854a3e93c4456790ce21ad89938.lyrics.txt

A long stone and my day's all serpentine. The tired tarnish in my chest rests sense of SARS. And one dull dawn where they hum that splits its length. Does my name sting your tongue?  Now does it beg?. . Your thin frame has set my eyes to fray. On our dim stretch of this street how it aches. For every grey and sad and taut to coil. And our frail eyes and there watch to finally talk. . One brash phrase cut crush these fragile days. My thoughts swirl in some shrill sad cannonade. And one such spur that caused my throat to creak. The one dull dawn that I've since sensed to repeat,calm.============1496a7b94739818f1f1199ed457f0368.lyrics.txt

But I talked him down to 17. . I took it home I don't know. Even though it's sometimes a pain in the ass.

Sombrero cantava e cercava una sposa. sembra che erano in dieci. quel giorno a seguire nella pampa Sombrero. un colpo di fuoco nel cuore. spezzò la vita del caballero. che amava soffriva rideva moriva. nessuno l'ha visto morire. per questo la gente sa che non è vero. negli occhi di chi ha sofferto. c'è una speranza un amico Sombrero. e cantando le sue canzoni. le storie di sangue le storie d'amore. anche se lui non c'è più. ha lasciato al paese un po' del suo cuore.,funny.============7d82d42229fa470c2268b460e3f5dcb2.lyrics.txt

And I'll coast down the length of your drive by the light of the moon. And the next time I see you - a new kind of hello. Both our hearts have a secret only both of us know. 'Bout the night that I drove you back home Kathleen,energetic.============7fd916008ece2fdb3590b92e06feb9b5.lyrics.txt
All the other girls here are stars - you are the northern lights. They try to shine in through your curtains - you're too close and too bright. They try and they try but everything that they do. Is the ghost of a trace of a pale imitation of you. I'll be the one to drive you back home Kathleen. . This party was made with the night air and the chance that a smile. Will wind its way from your face to one of the boys in your line. You act like you're hip to their tricks and you're strong. But a virgin Wurlitzer heart never once had a song. I'll be the one to drive you back home Kathleen. . And I'll have you back by break of day. I'm going your way anyway. And if you'd like to come along. I'll be yours for a song. . I know you are waiting and I know that it is not for me. But I'm here and I'm ready and I've saved you the passenger seat. I won't be your last dance just your last goodnight.

All there years you've been speaking without breathing. Spinning closer to the sun. Had your way with an unsuspecting public. Little threads are all it takes. La la la la .... I have learned all your secrets so familiar. I know where you lay your head. Fear of god and a disappointing father. Holds the hand around your neck. La la la la .... Sometimes I could just choke myself with laughter. Sometimes everything's so true. So when you come down from your death-defying labors. I'll still be in love with you. La la la la ...,calm.============e9660854a3e93c4456790ce21ad89938.lyrics.txt

A long stone and my day's all serpentine. The tired tarnish in my chest rests sense of SARS. And one dull dawn where they hum that splits its length. Does my name sting your tongue?

And our frail eyes and there watch to finally talk. . One brash phrase cut crush these fragile days. My thoughts swirl in some shrill sad cannonade. And one such spur that caused my throat to creak. The one dull dawn that I've since sensed to repeat,calm.============1496a7b94739818f1f1199ed457f0368.lyrics.txt

In a year and a day to be sure. That your face doesn't alter. Your words never falter -- I love you. . I'll be here waiting later and later. Hoping the night will go away. Andalucia Castles and Christians. Andalucia come to stay. You were lost on a day much like this. When you'd made up your mind not to come. And I couldn't persuade you. Or wait till tomorrow -- or pass the time,sad.============56534c095683e21dbaeaa52fad489e17.lyrics.txt
Anda my love. Wake up to your window . The day calls in billows . It's echoing moonlight onto the blue nightmare of your heart. In cosy red rainbow . It's shaking off halos . And the memory of our sacred so and so's. . Oh take my hand sweet . Complete your release. Unbury your feet . And married we'll be. Alone in receiving ours is a feeling. Not that they would see. They don't know that we could be . Down where your cradle escaped the sea . And your raven-haired mama caught told you so's. . We're laying in the shadow of your family tree . Your haunted heart and me. Brought down by an old idea whose time has come . And in the shadow of the gallows of your family tree . There's a hundred hearts or three. Pumping blood to the roots of evil to keep them young . . Ah me all mine. Is it safe to say that we've waited patiently . Call me on time . And recall the tune that has placed us gracefully . All into line . There's a garden grave and a place there saved for you . I fall by your side . Though your silver-haired mama throws told-you so's . . We're laying in the shadow of your family tree. Your haunted heart and me. Brought down by an old idea whose time has come. And in the shadow of the gallows of your family tree. There's a hundred hearts or three. Pumping blood to the roots of evil to keep them young. . Now we're gathered in the shadow of your family tree. In halted harmony. Brought down by an old idea whose time has come . And in the shadow of the valley of your family tree. There's a hundred hearts or three. Pumping blood to the roots of Eden to keep us young,calm.============0767e6093b36cc36baf139d694372961.lyrics.txt

Critical eyes are gazing . Fat cows are grazing . My eyes are glazing . How can you see straight with all the lies . I'm too young . You think you're old . Why don't you just hold me cold . I don't like it when you talk about yourself like that . It changes the way that I feel . There'll be no bad dreams . When you're lying next to me . I don't care about the rules . We only answer to ourselves . Answer to ourselves . Why does my sleep tell me of lies . Waking life full of rotten surprise . Why do all the strangers care . Who knows who is there . If you are here and I am where? . Trapped in the cell of your own brain . Blood is scarcely moving through your shriveled veins . Don't let yourself pass you by . It can happen in the blink of an eye . There'll be no bad dreams . When you're lying next to me . I don't care about the rules . We only answer to ourselves . Until we fall awake . I feel old now you seem young . I spent too much time out in the sun . I got a wrinkle to show for every day . Give 'em back to me again . I'll spend them the same,calm.============b5b49b5b2e990aac3a44a6e0549ed31d.lyrics.txt

Sun been down for days. A pretty flower in a vase. A slipper by the fireplace. A cello lying in its case. . Soon she's down the stairs. Her morning elegance she wears. The sound of water makes her dream. Awoken by a cloud of steam. She pours a daydream in a cup. A spoon of sugar sweetens up. . And she fights for her life. As she puts on her coat. And she fights for her life on the train. She looks at the rain as it pours. And she fights for her life. As she goes in a store. With a thought she has caught by a thread. She pays for the bread. And she goes.... . Nobody knows. . Sun been down for days. A winter melody she plays. The thunder makes her contemplate. She hears a noise behind the gate. Perhaps a letter with a dove. Perhaps a stranger she could love. . And she fights for her life. As she puts on her coat. And she fights for her life on the train. She looks at the rain as it pours. And she fights for her life. As she goes in a store. With a thought she has caught by a thread. She pays for the bread. And she goes.... . Nobody knows. Nobody knows.... . And she fights for her life. As she puts on her coat.

All the other girls here are stars - you are the northern lights. They try to shine in through your curtains - you're too close and too bright. They try and they try but everything that they do. Is the ghost of a trace of a pale imitation of you. I'll be the one to drive you back home Kathleen. . This party was made with the night air and the chance that a smile. Will wind its way from your face to one of the boys in your line. You act like you're hip to their tricks and you're strong. But a virgin Wurlitzer heart never once had a song. I'll be the one to drive you back home Kathleen. . And I'll have you back by break of day. I'm going your way anyway. And if you'd like to come along. I'll be yours for a song. . I know you are waiting and I know that it is not for me. But I'm here and I'm ready and I've saved you the passenger seat. I won't be your last dance just your last goodnight. Every heart is a package tangled up in knots someone else tied. I'll be the one to drive you back home Kathleen. . So crawl up your trellis and quietly back into your room. And I'll coast down the length of your drive by the light of the moon. And the next time I see you - a new kind of hello. Both our hearts have a secret only both of us know. 'Bout the night that I drove you back home Kathleen,energetic.============7fd916008ece2fdb3590b92e06feb9b5.lyrics.txt

Andalucia when can I see you. When it is snowing out again. Farmer John wants you. Louder and softer closer and nearer. Then again. Needing you taking you keeping you leaving you. In a year and a day to be sure. That your face doesn't alter. Your words never falter -- I love you. . I'll be here waiting later and later. Hoping the night will go away.

Anda my love. Wake up to your window . The day calls in billows . It's echoing moonlight onto the blue nightmare of your heart. In cosy red rainbow . It's shaking off halos . And the memory of our sacred so and so's. . Oh take my hand sweet . Complete your release. Unbury your feet . And married we'll be. Alone in receiving ours is a feeling. Not that they would see. They don't know that we could be . Down where your cradle escaped the sea . And your raven-haired mama caught told you so's. . We're laying in the shadow of your family tree . Your haunted heart and me. Brought down by an old idea whose time has come . And in the shadow of the gallows of your family tree . There's a hundred hearts or three. Pumping blood to the roots of evil to keep them young . . Ah me all mine. Is it safe to say that we've waited patiently . Call me on time . And recall the tune that has placed us gracefully . All into line . There's a garden grave and a place there saved for you . I fall by your side . Though your silver-haired mama throws told-you so's . . We're laying in the shadow of your family tree. Your haunted heart and me. Brought down by an old idea whose time has come. And in the shadow of the gallows of your family tree. There's a hundred hearts or three. Pumping blood to the roots of evil to keep them young. . Now we're gathered in the shadow of your family tree. In halted harmony. Brought down by an old idea whose time has come . And in the shadow of the valley of your family tree. There's a hundred hearts or three. Pumping blood to the roots of Eden to keep us young,lonely.============0767e6093b36cc36baf139d694372961.lyrics.txt
Anda my love. Wake up to your window . The day calls in billows . It's echoing moonlight onto the blue nightmare of your heart. In cosy red rainbow . It's shaking off halos . And the memory of our sacred so and so's. . Oh take my hand sweet . Complete your release. Unbury your feet . And married we'll be. Alone in receiving ours is a feeling. Not that they would see. They don't know that we could be . Down where your cradle escaped the sea . And your raven-haired mama caught told you so's. . We're laying in the shadow of your family tree .

Are you waiting for me?. At the end of the airport. I'm off buying our tickets. Auteur in hibernation. But I'm feeling impatient. We were late for departure. . And the smell of pajamas. Is what makes me feel frivol. There are minutes for sleeping. But we didn't have minutes to spare. . So you're feeling sleepy. Sympathize with the retard. Being held by his mother. She's got spit in her napkin. And she's pushing him that way. Like a stench to the men's room. . And it's making you nauseous. Where the hell have I got to?. There's a boy who's a Krishna. And he thinks you look pretty. Well holiday fun),angry.============358ee667bf3899d4e2b4b18067331569.lyrics.txt
Are you waiting for somebody else to move. Don't you know in your heart . Is the power to change everything. Don't you know in your heart . Is the power to change everything. .

A small Jean Genie snuck off to the city. Strung out on lasers and slash back blazers and. Ate all your razors while pulling the waiters. Talking 'bout Monroe and walking on Snow White.

As someone sets light to the first fire of autumn. We settle down to cut ourselves apart. Cough and twitch from the news on your face. And some foreign candle burning in your eyes. . Held to the past we've no recourse at all. . Blind to the last cursed affair. Pistols and countless lies. A trail of white blood betrays. The reckless route your craft is running. . Feed 'til the sun turns into wood. Dousing an ancient torch. Loiter the whole day through. And lose yourself in lines dissecting love,happy.============8c3fc0d993cf643b1289596024853e3d.lyrics.txt

As soon as I got on the horse I forgot about the math.. Forgot about the odds against an adolescent standing up to all of Owen's wrath.. The heat of prairie summer is impossible to take.. I grab the hem and lift the fabric over my sweet head.. I know what you're looking for and I'm never gonna give it to you.. I'm never gonna give it to you.. I'm never gonna give it to you.. . Government rule established by a dazzling light show.. A hegemony armored with a thousand-watt head and seven inches of echo.. I keep up my velocity my spurs are in her sides.. I don't know what I'm doing and it is the only way.. Toward the range I'll ride. I'm never gonna give it to you.. I'm never gonna give it to you.. I'm never gonna give it to you.,lonely.============afc3b42524eadc10e2ac2cea0a717d1f.lyrics.txt

As the spring is made alive the winter dies. And the final cries of creatures are long behind. And full of spirit the village starts again. With one more year for a man to change his ways. . I used to feel all things around me stir. Grateful for all I received. Taking in the sounds and ways of creatures upon the earth. Great were the rivers I swam waiting out the sun. . As the winter dies the earth is brought to life. And a thousand merchant ships sail to find. A worthy village to land and start again. With one more year for a man to change his ways. . I used to feel all things around me stir. Grateful for all I received. Taking in the sounds and ways of creatures upon the earth. Great were the rivers I swam waiting out the sun. . I used to feel all things around me stir. I’d hear the sound of creatures upon the earth. Grateful for all I received. Though winter cold and spring,high.============920a7409d8b5d4e9931fedf1252a97c9.lyrics.txt

As we fall into sequence. And we're eating our young. Remain silent and still for modesty. . When the splints have been broken. And they can't help you now.

at night we crossed the border following a Black robe. to the edge of the reservation—to Cataldo Mission. where the saints and all the martyrs look down on dying converts. . . Yeah. It's my home—last night I dreamt that I grew wings. I found a place where they could hear me when I sing.. . and so they came with cameras—breaking through the morning mist. press and businessmen—tycoons—Episcopal philanthropists. lost in their appraisal of the body of a woman. but all we saw were lowlands—clouds clung to mountains without strings. . and at last we saw some people... . at last we saw some people.... at last we saw some people huddled up against. the rain that was descending like railroad spikes and hammers. they were headed for the border—walking and then running. and then they were gone into the fog but Anne said underneath their jackets she saw wings,sad.============8a88ba7ffd5217b66304345799fa884e.lyrics.txt

At the starting of the week. At summit talks you'll hear them speak. It's only Monday. Negotiations breaking down. See those leaders start to frown. It's sword and gun day. . Tomorrow never comes until it's too late. . You could be sitting taking lunch. The news will hit you like a punch. It's only Tuesday. You never thought we'd go to war. After all the things we saw. It's April Fools day. . Tomorrow never comes until it's too late. . We'll all go running underground. And we'll be listening for the sound. It's only Wednesday. In your shelter dimly lit. Take some wool and learn to knit. Cause it's a long day. . Tomorrow never comes until it's too late. . You hear a whistling overhead. Are you alive or are you dead?. It's only Thursday. You feel a shaking on the ground. A billion candles burn around. Is it your birthday?. . Tomorrow never comes until it's too late. . Although that shelter is your home. A living space you have outgrown. It's only Friday. As you come out to the light. Can your eyes behold the sight?. It must be doomsday. . Tomorrow never comes until it's too late. . Ain't it funny how men think. They made the bomb they are extinct. It's only Saturday. . I think tomorrow's come I think it's too late. I think tomorrow's come I think it's too late.

Baby's into running around. Hanging with the crowd. Putting your business in the street talking out loud. Saying you bought her this and that. And how much you done spent.

(Who I wonder who) gave her that big idea. . Nothing you can't handle nothing you ain't got. Put the money on the table and drive it off the lot. Turn on that ole lovelight and turn a maybe to a yes. Same old schoolboy game got you into this mess. Hey son better get back to town. Face the sad old truth the dirty lowdown. . (Who I wonder who) put those ideas in your head. (Who I wonder who) yeah. Come on back down little son. Dig the low low low low lowdown. . You ain't got to be so bad got to be so cold. This dog eat dog existence sure is getting old. Got to have a Jones for this Jones for that. This running with the Joneses boy. Just ain't where it's at. You gonna come back around. To the sad sad truth the dirty lowdown. .

Baby's on fire. Better throw her in the water. Look at her laughing. Like a heifer to the slaughter. . Baby's on fire. And all the laughing boys are bitching. Waiting for photos. Oh the plot is so bewitching. . Rescuers row row. Do your best to change the subject. Blow the wind blow blow. Lend some assistance to the object. . Photographers snip snap. Take your time she's only burning. This kind of experience. Is necessary for her learning. . If you'll be my flotsam. I could be half the man I used to. They said you were hot stuff. And that's what baby's been reduced to. . Juanita and Juan. Very clever with maracas. Making their fortunes. Selling secondhand tobaccoes. . Juan dances at Chico's. And when the clients are evicted. He empties the ashtrays. And pockets all that he's collected. . But baby's on fire. And all the instruments agree that. Her temperature's rising. But any idiot would know that,happy.============1b2cebfef9dc31289b0cd7f98cc11f8b.lyrics.txt

Bailey's her name and there's a price she takes. . Blurring lines while she ruthlessly raised the stakes. . And there's a mess that she made. .

Do you remember me? 'Cause there's a tale I tell. . It's made of rain and hell. . We will seldom speak our bodies became arsonists to will and brains. . To him the cold hearted thing was she came demanding rings. . The day was mute and hot. We will rarely talk. . I'm just where you left me alone by them lilacs.,lonely.============931d7d74fe09b523cf82e3b75a2e0329.lyrics.txt

As the descent began I got the distinct impression. Lake Michigan had been frozen for decades. I conducted the warmth from my metronome sternum. To our massive jetting vessel billowing plumes of spent fuel. . The tundra under us cracked and ruptured. To reveal palisades. Made of blades of gray gray bristling grass. And papulose lichen. I was so frightened. As my grip on you tightened. Your skin got slicker. . I am a deserted bus depot. Though our approach suggested. An American hazy sea. Like the one I found inside. After driving you home once. Still half high. . I-90 through utter desolation. I sense evil at the heart of each far flung well lighted home. I close my eyes and see cellar stairways. Vermiculated with delicate animal bone. . Musty rooms house racks of fur jackets. Spattered with plasma. On a bus in Indiana. I called you and screamed. Under ceaseless patterns of weeping light,happy.============6689266087fd4026918282281653d575.lyrics.txt

I said it. beat beat me to death. gray death beat me to death. Jimmy is abortedt. beat beat beat beat beat beat,sad.============14382de5a6283e8f393d9f4f695a1028.lyrics.txt
Been round this road so many times . Feel like it's skin is part of mine . This taste of milk is almost gone . Still got my shame that my days they're all gone,energetic.============34679db49ad219dd21a54e6fd3dcf061.lyrics.txt
Beep beep beep beep beep beep beep. go the horns in the cars in the street. we walked away from the lover's leap. opposite directions. synchronised feet. wait wait wait wait wait wait wait. for the time it takes a heart to mend a break. how many moons are reflected in the lake. can you wait forever if time is all it takes. despite all the warnings. I landed like. a fallen star. in your arms. beat beat beat beat beat beat beat. goes my heart on the side of my sleeve. whispering something I can hardly believe. "let me take the lead. cos love is all we need,lonely.============136e83294eafdae822625c7232004a67.lyrics.txt
Before I let you down again . I just want to see you in your eyes . I would have taken everything out on you . I only thought you could understand . . They say every man goes blind in his heart . And they say everybody steals somebody's heart away . And I've got nothing more to say about it . Nothing more than you would me . . Send me your flowers of your december . Send me your dreams of your candy wine . I got just one thing I can't give you . Just one more thing of mine . . They say every man goes blind in his heart . They say everybody steals somebody's heart away . And I've been wondering why you let me down . And I been taking it all for granted,sexy.============ddd7677e9d541f27a3836ae57630f48b.lyrics.txt
