I was too.. busy staring at you.... You.... . So then we were floating up<comma> we were floating like particles into the night. High above the factories. We hitched a lift on a satellite. Lover<comma> will you spin me round?. May we never fall back to ground. . Well it's all up from here. It's like I can taste opportunity near. I cut myself on barbed wire. Getting wood for the fire.

You never hear me talk about one day getting out. Why put a new address on the same old loneliness. Everybody knows where that is. We built that house of his. And when he's not home. Someone else you know always is. If Heaven's really coming back. I hope it has a heart attack. When they see how dangerous it is for guys like that. The night has always known when it's time to get going. When it's really been so long that it starts showing. It's always had that ghost who always almost. Tells me the Secret. How there's really no difference in who he was once. And who he's become. Everything you hated me for… Honey there was so much more. I just didn't get busted.. But I'm not looking for an easy way out. This whole life it's been about. Try and try and try. And try and try and try. To be simple again,lonely.
You've been on your own as long as I recall. If loneliness was art<comma> I could hang you from the wall. In some Berlin hall. It doesn't matter where you've been or who you have been with. It's like the Just Joans said: "you're oh so sensitive!". In that jumper<comma> in that t-shirt. . This situation has to change. Can you feel the pulse. My heavy heart race?. Some day I'm going to be your girl. One fine day: I'm going to be your girl. . Shalalalala.... . When I'm all alone I find a map of the world. Zoom in on your island 'til the pixels form. Have some booze 'til I can't see you. . This situation has to change. Can you feel the pulse. My heavy heart race?. Some day<comma> I'm going to be your girl. One fine day<comma> you're going to make me your girl. . Shalalalala.... . We make believe that our hearts are never shot. And somehow you've convinced me that I'm pretty when I'm not. Everybody I know wants to be your friend. But I just want to hold you when the music ends. That's all<comma> all I ask. Is that too crass?. . This situation has to change. Can you feel the pulse. My heavy heart race?. Some day I'm going to be your girl. One fine day<comma> you're going to make me your girl. . Shalalalala...,lonely.
