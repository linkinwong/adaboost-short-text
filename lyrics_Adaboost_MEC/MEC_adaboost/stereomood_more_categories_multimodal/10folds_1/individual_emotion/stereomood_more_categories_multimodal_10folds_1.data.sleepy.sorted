I lose some sales and my boss won't be happy . But I can't stop listening to the sound . Of two soft voices rendered in perfection . From the reels of this record that I found . Every day there's a boy in the mirror . Asking me what are you doing here . Finding all my previous motives . Growing increasingly unclear . . I've travelled far and I've burned all the bridges . I believed as soon as I hit land. All the other options held before me . Will wither in the light of my plan . So I lose some sales and my boss won't be happy. But there's only one thing on my mind . Searching boxes underneath the counter . On a chance that on a tape I'd find . A song for . Someone who needs somewhere . To long for . . Homesick . Cause I no longer know . Where home is,sleepy.

I'm losing your train of thought. Watching my mind get lost. Appended to the breeze. Talking amongst the trees. . Cannot find the words to use. The thoughts that I would write. Over-analyzing how the leaves eclipse the light. Constantly find meaning. And naivety inside. Lost within my wonder. As the day turns into night. . All of the mysteries. Conflicts. Discoveries. Hiding in frequencies. Keeping the mind at ease. . Staring at the sky. While you are blurring out the line. If the colors and the shapes. Were clearly more defined. Thinking on a concept. Seems like getting off the course. Writing to myself. Then later questioning the source,sleepy.
