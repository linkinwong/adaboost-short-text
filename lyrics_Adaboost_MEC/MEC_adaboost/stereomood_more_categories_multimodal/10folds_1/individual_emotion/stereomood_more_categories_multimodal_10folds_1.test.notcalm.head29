J'ai peur que ce qui m'entoure finisse par m'atteindre. Le tiers-monde court à sa perte<comma> on devient sourd. J'm'appelle Bouchkour welcome to my land. Stop the time I become crazy. Stop the time I am crazy. . . J'ai les mains pleines de promesses dans ce perpétuel mouvement. En sens inverse chaque minute ramène au présent. Tout s'accélère<comma> le passé devient faiblesse. Chacun ses fantômes et ses tourments. J'ai laissé toutes mes vieilles rancoeur derrière moi. Comme si j'ouvrais mon coeur pour la dernière fois. Le temps file entre mes doigts.... Comment faire le compte de ce que j'ai raté à cause de mes choix?. Les aiguilles courent<comma> je les poursuis. Elles filent jour après jour mais ca ne suffit. A rattraper tout le temps perdu<comma> toutes ces heures investies. A gagner tous toute une vie. On ne peut stocker l'amour au fond d'un puits. Car c'est au jour le jour qu'on le construit. Profite de chaque instant vécu. N'avoir aucun regret lorsque tout ici sera fini !. J'ai les mains pleines de richesses mais je ne parle pas d'argent. Car on progresse dans notre voie passionnément. J'ai laissé derrière tant de moments importants. Maintenant je l'ai compris a mes dépens. Et puis tout s'ouvre devant moi<comma> malgré ce que l'on laisse derrière soi. Bons ou mauvais instants<comma> nos peines et toutes nos joies. J' n'oublierai pas ces moments-là.,high.
Been round this road so many times . Feel like it's skin is part of mine . This taste of milk is almost gone . Still got my shame<comma> but not for long! . Been wrong so many times before . But never quite like this . And oh<comma> it rained<comma> but the rain all turned to piss. . I hope to make it home one day. I doubt that day will come. I know<comma> by now<comma> that my days they're all gone,energetic.
