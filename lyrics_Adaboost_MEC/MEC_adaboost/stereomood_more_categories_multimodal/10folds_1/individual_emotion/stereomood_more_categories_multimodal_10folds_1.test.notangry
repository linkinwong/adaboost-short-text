Don't plagiarise or take 'on loan'. There's always someone<comma> somewhere. With a big nose who knows. And who trips you up and laughs. When you fall. Who'll trip you up and laugh. When you fall. You say: "Ere long done do does did". Words which could only be your own. And then produce the text. From whence was ripped. 'Some dizzy whore'<comma> 1804. A dreaded sunny day.

Coconut Grove . Is a very small cove . Separated from the sea . By a shifting shoal . We didn't realize that . We had arrived . At high tide<comma> high tide . Barely made it out alive . . Red over white . Fishermen working at night . Not even once . Did we see a light . We didn't realize . The forecast had been revised . By moonless skies and. Shifty wind that gusts and dies. . On the sand our keel is heaving . But tonight we've got to be leaving. Travel through the day and into the evening . . Marathon how long we've been gone . And still not yet set foot upon you . . Your low lying shore opens welcomingly. To one who's spent the night at sea. Adrift in the shallows<comma> a modest repose. Adorn with coral<comma> your bright colors show. Ushered in through a bridge that is never closed,happy.

The bricks that rose now fall. Rivers flow. Where they could not flow. Times are different now. The bricks that rose now fall. Willows grow . Where they could not grow. Rivers flow.

It's been a long and lonely trip but I'm glad that I took it because it was well worth it.. I got to read a couple books and do some research before I reached my verdict.. Never thought that I was perfect. Always thought that I had a purpose.. Used to wonder if I'd live to see my first kiss.. . The most difficult thing I ever did was recite my own words at a service. Realizing the person I was addressing probably wasn't looking down from heaven.. Or cooking up something in hell's kitchen<comma> trying to listen in or eaves drop from some another dimension.. It was self serving just like this is.. . Conveniently religious on Easter Sunday and on Christmas.. The television went from being a babysitter to a mistress.. Technology made it easy for us to stay in touch while keeping a distance<comma>. 'til we just stayed distant and never touched. Now all we do is text too much.. . I don't remember much from my youth. Maybe my memory is repressed.. Or I just spent too much time wondering if I'd live to have sex.. Fell in love for the first time in 4th grade but I didn't have the courage to talk to her.. In 8th grade I wrote her the note but I slipped it in someone else's locker.. . Considered killing myself 'cause of that.. It was a big deal. It was a blown cover.. It was over for me. My goose was cooked.. Stick a fork in me. The jig is up.. I blew my chances<comma> the rest is history<comma> our future was torn asunder.. It became abundantly clear that I was only brought here to suffer.. . At least I didn't include my name.. Thankfully I wrote the whole note in code. And it had 10 layers of scotch tape safety seal making it impossible to open.. Plus<comma> it was set to self destruct.. Whoever read it probably died…laughing.. I wonder if they lived long enough to realize what happened.. . A year later<comma> I came to understand that wasn't love that I was feeling for her.. I had someone else to obsess over.. I was older. I was very mature.. I forged my time signature while practicing my parents autograph 'cause I was failing math.. Disconnected the phone when I thought the teacher would call my home.. . I checked the mailbox twice a day at the end of a long dirt road.. Steamed open a couple envelopes like I was in private detective mode.. If you snoop around long enough for something in particular you're guaranteed to find it.. For better or worse that's how I learned that it's best to just keep some things private.. . It was the best of times. It was the end of times.. . It was the best of times. It was the end of times.. I was always on deck<comma> I was next in line.. An only child with a pen and pad writing a list of things that I could never have.. The walls in my house were paper thin.. Every squabble seemed to get deafening.. If my memory serves me correctly I made it a point to void and forget some things.. Probably to keep from being embarrassed.. Never meant to upset or give grief to my parents.. Kept my secrets…hid my talents…. In my head<comma> never under the mattress.. . Therapy couldn't break me.. Never learned a word that would insure safety.. So I spoke softly and I tip toed often.. The door to my room was like a big old coffin.. The way that it creeked when I closed it shut.. Anxieties peaked when it opened up.. As if everything that I was thinking would be exposed.. I still sleep fully clothed.. . It was the best of times.. . It was beautiful.. It was brutal.. It was cruel.. It was business as usual.. . Heaven. It was hell.. Used to wonder if I'd live to see 12.. . When I did I figured that I was immortal.. Loved to dance but couldn't make it to the formal.. Couldn't bear watching my imaginary girlfriend. Bust a move with any other dudes.. . Tone Loc was talking bout a "Wild Thang". But I was still caught up in some child thangs.. Scared of a God who couldn't spare the rod.. It was clearly a brimstone and fire thang.. . Pyromaniac. Kleptomaniac.. Couldn't explain my desire to steal that fire.. Now I add it to my rider.. Like "Please oh please don't throw me in that patch of brier!". . It was the best of times. It was the end of times.. . The school counselor was clueless 'cause I never skipped classes.. Perfect attendance. Imperfect accent.. Speech impediment they could never really fix. And I faked bad eyesight so I could wear glasses.. . Considered doing something that would cripple me.. I wanted a wheelchair. I wanted the sympathy.. I wanted straight teeth so then came braces.. 4 years of head gear helped me change faces.. . It was the best of times. It was the end of times.. . Now I wonder if I'll live to see marriage.. Wonder if I'll live long enough to have kids.. Wonder if I'll live to see my kids have kids.. If I do I'm gonna tell 'em how it is.. . "Don't listen when they tell you that these are your best years.. Don't let anybody protect your ears.. It's best that you hear what they don't want you to hear.. It's better to have pressure from peers than not have peers.. Beer won't give you chest hair. Spicy food won't make it curl.. When you think you've got it all figured out and then everything collapses…. Trust me<comma> kid…it's not the end of the world.",energetic.

You never hear me talk about one day getting out. Why put a new address on the same old loneliness. Everybody knows where that is. We built that house of his. And when he's not home. Someone else you know always is. If Heaven's really coming back. I hope it has a heart attack. When they see how dangerous it is for guys like that. The night has always known when it's time to get going. When it's really been so long that it starts showing. It's always had that ghost who always almost. Tells me the Secret. How there's really no difference in who he was once. And who he's become. Everything you hated me for… Honey there was so much more. I just didn't get busted.. But I'm not looking for an easy way out. This whole life it's been about. Try and try and try. And try and try and try. To be simple again,lonely.
