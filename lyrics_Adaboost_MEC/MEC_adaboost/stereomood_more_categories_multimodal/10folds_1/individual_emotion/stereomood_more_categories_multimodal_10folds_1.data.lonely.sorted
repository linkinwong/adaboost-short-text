It's been a long and lonely trip but I'm glad that I took it because it was well worth it.. I got to read a couple books and do some research before I reached my verdict.. Never thought that I was perfect. Always thought that I had a purpose.. Used to wonder if I'd live to see my first kiss.. . The most difficult thing I ever did was recite my own words at a service. Realizing the person I was addressing probably wasn't looking down from heaven.. Or cooking up something in hell's kitchen<comma> trying to listen in or eaves drop from some another dimension.. It was self serving just like this is.. . Conveniently religious on Easter Sunday and on Christmas.. The television went from being a babysitter to a mistress.. Technology made it easy for us to stay in touch while keeping a distance<comma>. 'til we just stayed distant and never touched. Now all we do is text too much.. . I don't remember much from my youth. Maybe my memory is repressed.. Or I just spent too much time wondering if I'd live to have sex.. Fell in love for the first time in 4th grade but I didn't have the courage to talk to her.. In 8th grade I wrote her the note but I slipped it in someone else's locker.. . Considered killing myself 'cause of that.. It was a big deal. It was a blown cover.. It was over for me. My goose was cooked.. Stick a fork in me. The jig is up.. I blew my chances<comma> the rest is history<comma> our future was torn asunder.. It became abundantly clear that I was only brought here to suffer.. . At least I didn't include my name.. Thankfully I wrote the whole note in code. And it had 10 layers of scotch tape safety seal making it impossible to open.. Plus<comma> it was set to self destruct.. Whoever read it probably died…laughing.. I wonder if they lived long enough to realize what happened.. . A year later<comma> I came to understand that wasn't love that I was feeling for her.. I had someone else to obsess over.. I was older. I was very mature.. I forged my time signature while practicing my parents autograph 'cause I was failing math.. Disconnected the phone when I thought the teacher would call my home.. . I checked the mailbox twice a day at the end of a long dirt road.. Steamed open a couple envelopes like I was in private detective mode.. If you snoop around long enough for something in particular you're guaranteed to find it.. For better or worse that's how I learned that it's best to just keep some things private.. . It was the best of times. It was the end of times.. . It was the best of times. It was the end of times.. I was always on deck<comma> I was next in line.. An only child with a pen and pad writing a list of things that I could never have.. The walls in my house were paper thin.. Every squabble seemed to get deafening.. If my memory serves me correctly I made it a point to void and forget some things.. Probably to keep from being embarrassed.. Never meant to upset or give grief to my parents.. Kept my secrets…hid my talents…. In my head<comma> never under the mattress.. . Therapy couldn't break me.. Never learned a word that would insure safety.. So I spoke softly and I tip toed often.. The door to my room was like a big old coffin.. The way that it creeked when I closed it shut.. Anxieties peaked when it opened up.. As if everything that I was thinking would be exposed.. I still sleep fully clothed.. . It was the best of times.. . It was beautiful.. It was brutal.. It was cruel.. It was business as usual.. . Heaven. It was hell.. Used to wonder if I'd live to see 12.. . When I did I figured that I was immortal.. Loved to dance but couldn't make it to the formal.. Couldn't bear watching my imaginary girlfriend. Bust a move with any other dudes.. . Tone Loc was talking bout a "Wild Thang". But I was still caught up in some child thangs.. Scared of a God who couldn't spare the rod.. It was clearly a brimstone and fire thang.. . Pyromaniac. Kleptomaniac.. Couldn't explain my desire to steal that fire.. Now I add it to my rider.. Like "Please oh please don't throw me in that patch of brier!". . It was the best of times. It was the end of times.. . The school counselor was clueless 'cause I never skipped classes.. Perfect attendance. Imperfect accent.. Speech impediment they could never really fix. And I faked bad eyesight so I could wear glasses.. . Considered doing something that would cripple me.. I wanted a wheelchair. I wanted the sympathy.. I wanted straight teeth so then came braces.. 4 years of head gear helped me change faces.. . It was the best of times. It was the end of times.. . Now I wonder if I'll live to see marriage.. Wonder if I'll live long enough to have kids.. Wonder if I'll live to see my kids have kids.. If I do I'm gonna tell 'em how it is.. . "Don't listen when they tell you that these are your best years.. Don't let anybody protect your ears.. It's best that you hear what they don't want you to hear.. It's better to have pressure from peers than not have peers.. Beer won't give you chest hair. Spicy food won't make it curl.. When you think you've got it all figured out and then everything collapses…. Trust me<comma> kid…it's not the end of the world.",lonely.
It’s been a long<comma> long time since. I’ve memorized your face. It’s been four hours now since. I’ve wandered through your place. . And when I sleep on your couch. I feel very safe.

And when you crochet. I feel mesmerized and proud. And I would say I love you<comma>. but saying it out loud<comma> is hard. . So I won’t say it at all. And I won’t stay very long. . But you are the life. I needed all along. I think of you as my brother. Although that sounds dumb. . And words are futile devices,lonely.

It's plain to see<comma> the sun won't shine today. But I ain't in the mood for sunshine anyway. Maybe I'll go insane. I got to stop the pain. Or maybe I'll go down to see Kathleen.. .

The stars hang high above<comma> the oceans roar. The moon is come to lead me to her door. There's crystal across the sand. And the waves<comma> they take my hand.. And soon I'm gonna see my sweet Kathleen.. . Soon I'm gonna see my sweet Kathleen.,lonely.

Pain. I guess it's a matter of sensation. But somehow. You have a way of avoiding it all. . In my mind. I have shot you and stabbed you through your heart. I just didn't understand. The ricochet is the second part. . Cause you can't hide. What you intend. It glows in the dark. Once you've sought. The path of revenge. There's no way to stop. And the more I try to hurt you. The more that it hurts me. . Strange. It seems like a character mutation. Though I have all the means . of bringing you fuckers down. I can't make myself. To destroy upon command. Somehow forgiveness . lets the evil make the laws. . No you can't hide. What you intend. It glows in the dark. Once we've become . The thing we dread. There's no way to stop. And the more I try to hurt you. The more it backfires. The more it backfires. The more that it backfires,lonely.

Saul Williams:. . Please Mr. Nichols come back inside the window. I can't promise you anything<comma> but I trust that there is far greater reason to live. I know you've become disheartened and disillusioned by the current state of affairs. Your stocks are falling<comma> your investments have failed you. The man from whom you took orders has been ordered to jail by his and your subordinates. You question what is this world coming to. What is the profit margin when you're forced to pander to the marginalized. Where's the glory you dreamt of as a child... Dressed as a cowboy<comma> your play gun pointed at real targets. Your mother<comma> holding her tongue as your father consoles her with the words... “it's just boy stuff”. . Well. You joined his fraternity<comma> you grew into his old suits. You acquired his beliefs<comma> you embodied his dreams and with them his oversights.. How long did you think it would last?. It's just a matter of time.. The world is far from over.. . Look.... Your mother outlives your father<comma>. Your sister outlives your brother.. And if you jump from this window today... She'll also outlive you..

Twelve stories above the ground. One story remaining untold.... . You contemplate the setting sun<comma>. Unaware of your disorientation.. Dis-orient: turned away from the east.. The shifting current seems to conspire against you.. Mr. Nichols<comma> you fail to see that you've always stood outside of this window<comma> perched on the threshold of oblivion.. Countless man made stories above the truth. For so long you've stood facing the setting sun. Mistaking the complimentary unified duality of nature as being right or wrong. Good or evil. God or devil. Mr. Nichols instead of stepping from this ledge into the downfall of your up rise. Why not just turn around. Lessen the intensity of your western glare and face the rising sun. Note the energy swirling from its center. How it illumines us all and only the birds fly first class.... . There is your inheritance!. The warmth of a kiss. Invest your tongue into the mouth of mystery. Allow her breath to seep into your lungs and surrender to her touch and guidance. There's no other way. Your dreams of dominance will only help you forsake yourself. While your family continues its search for understanding. And your daughters outlive your sons...,lonely.
