Sun been down for days. A pretty flower in a vase. A slipper by the fireplace. A cello lying in its case. . Soon she's down the stairs. Her morning elegance she wears.

And she fights for her life on the train. She looks at the rain as it pours. And she fights for her life. As she goes in a store. With a thought she has caught by a thread. She pays for the bread. And she goes.... . Nobody knows. . Sun been down for days. A winter melody she plays. The thunder makes her contemplate. She hears a noise behind the gate. Perhaps a letter with a dove.
