All the other girls here are stars - you are the northern lights. They try to shine in through your curtains - you're too close and too bright. They try and they try but everything that they do.

Snow covers Whitehall. White powdered Nembutal. And I can't think any more. My feet are like ice. And the moon sets. On Christmas trees and plastic deer . . I decided to forgive and forget. I thank god you're comatose. As I pull back the bedclothes. And I can't believe my composure. And I can't remember my anger. And summer is a fish story. I wonder where we'll be,lonely.

Andalucia when can I see you. When it is snowing out again. Farmer John wants you. Louder and softer closer and nearer. Then again. Needing you taking you keeping you leaving you.

As soon as I got on the horse I forgot about the math.. Forgot about the odds against an adolescent standing up to all of Owen's wrath.. The heat of prairie summer is impossible to take.. I grab the hem and lift the fabric over my sweet head.. I know what you're looking for and I'm never gonna give it to you.. I'm never gonna give it to you.. I'm never gonna give it to you.. . Government rule established by a dazzling light show.. A hegemony armored with a thousand-watt head and seven inches of echo.. I keep up my velocity my spurs are in her sides.. I don't know what I'm doing and it is the only way.. Toward the range I'll ride<comma> singing<comma> I'm never gonna give it to you.. I'm never gonna give it to you.. I'm never gonna give it to you.. . "I am overrated" said the sculptress to the sea.. "I've been praised for all the ways the marble leaves the man<comma>. And I was wrong to try and free him". And as for me I am a vector I am muscle I am bone.. The sun upon my shoulders and the horse between my legs<comma>. This is all I know.. . My senses are bedazzled by the parallax of the road.. I concentrate to keep contained the overflow.. My knuckles grip so tightly my fingers start to bleed.. If what I have is what you need<comma>. I'm never gonna give it to you.. I'm never gonna give it to you.. I'm never gonna give it to you.,lonely.
As the descent began I got the distinct impression. Lake Michigan had been frozen for decades. I conducted the warmth from my metronome sternum. To our massive jetting vessel billowing plumes of spent fuel. . The tundra under us cracked and ruptured. To reveal palisades. Made of blades of gray<comma> gray bristling grass. And papulose lichen. I was so frightened. As my grip on you tightened. Your skin got slicker. . I am a deserted bus depot. Though our approach suggested. An American hazy sea. Like the one I found inside. After driving you home once. Still half high. . I-90 through utter desolation. I sense evil at the heart of each far flung well lighted home. I close my eyes and see cellar stairways. Vermiculated with delicate animal bone. . Musty rooms house racks of fur jackets. Spattered with plasma. On a bus in Indiana. I called you and screamed. Under ceaseless patterns of weeping light,happy.
As the light hits you<comma>. As you shift along the floor<comma>. I find it hard to place my face.. How did I come to be here<comma> anyway?. It's terribly vague<comma> what's gone before.. .

at night we crossed the border following a Black robe. to the edge of the reservation—to Cataldo Mission. where the saints and all the martyrs look down on dying converts. <i>what makes the water holy</i> she says <i>is that that it's the closest thing to rain</i>. .

I said <i>inside this gilded cage a songbird always looks so plain</i>. . Yeah. It's my home—last night I dreamt that I grew wings. I found a place where they could hear me when I sing.. . and so they came with cameras—breaking through the morning mist. press and businessmen—tycoons—Episcopal philanthropists. lost in their appraisal of the body of a woman. but all we saw were lowlands—clouds clung to mountains without strings. . and at last we saw some people... . at last we saw some people.... at last we saw some people huddled up against. the rain that was descending like railroad spikes and hammers. they were headed for the border—walking and then running. and then they were gone into the fog but Anne said underneath their jackets she saw wings,calm.

Baby canteen<comma> when i thought your heart stopped beating. The room brought out the silence in your breathing. A birth in wooded housing will help you live beyond the numbers.

Marshmallow people say oh yeah<comma> cause they think it's a masterpiece. . The sky has brakes . What a good day to rise. De Soto De Son will time. .

Shooting from school. There's a green where the crickets cry mom can't breathe and i know she's leaving. And that the birds of a quay are all good for the crocodile. So slow it down. Its not a race. Death takes time. Do you see it?. . Baby canteen swollen fingers in the water . I roped an Island pony for your birthday. I'll live in wooded housing till they put out all your needles. And drop you in and shelter near the highway,calm.

Baby's into running around. Hanging with the crowd. Putting your business in the street talking out loud. Saying you bought her this and that. And how much you done spent. I swear she must believe it's all heaven sent. Hey boy you better bring the chick around. To the sad. sad truth the dirty lowdown. . (Who I wonder who) taught her how to talk like that. (Who I wonder who) gave her that big idea. . Nothing you can't handle nothing you ain't got. Put the money on the table and drive it off the lot. Turn on that ole lovelight and turn a maybe to a yes. Same old schoolboy game got you into this mess. Hey son better get back to town. Face the sad old truth the dirty lowdown. . (Who I wonder who) put those ideas in your head. (Who I wonder who) yeah. Come on back down little son. Dig the low low low low lowdown. . You ain't got to be so bad got to be so cold. This dog eat dog existence sure is getting old. Got to have a Jones for this Jones for that. This running with the Joneses boy. Just ain't where it's at. You gonna come back around. To the sad sad truth the dirty lowdown. . (Who I wonder who) got you thinking like that boy. (Who I wonder who). (Who I wonder who said who I wonder who). Oh look out for that lowdown. That dirty dirty dirty dirty lowdown. (Who I wonder who ohh ohh). Got you thinking like that,groovy.
Baby's on fire. Better throw her in the water. Look at her laughing. Like a heifer to the slaughter. . Baby's on fire. And all the laughing boys are bitching. Waiting for photos. Oh the plot is so bewitching. . Rescuers row row. Do your best to change the subject. Blow the wind blow blow. Lend some assistance to the object. . Photographers snip snap. Take your time she's only burning. This kind of experience. Is necessary for her learning. . If you'll be my flotsam. I could be half the man I used to. They said you were hot stuff. And that's what baby's been reduced to. . Juanita and Juan. Very clever with maracas. Making their fortunes. Selling secondhand tobaccoes. . Juan dances at Chico's. And when the clients are evicted. He empties the ashtrays. And pockets all that he's collected. . But baby's on fire. And all the instruments agree that. Her temperature's rising. But any idiot would know that,happy.

Bailey's her name and there's a price she takes. . Blurring lines while she ruthlessly raised the stakes. . And there's a mess that she made. .

Do you remember me? 'Cause there's a tale I tell. . It's made of rain and hell. . We will seldom speak<comma> and we will rarely talk. . Bailey<comma> your secret's known. .

The day was mute and hot. We will rarely talk. . I'm just where you left me alone by them lilacs.,lonely.

Basking in low gravity<comma> in a fog.. Wilting in your levity.. Whitewashing avenues of our widening disparities.. We never made a sound just stared at one another.. . The heavy clouds that crowd your head<comma> and above<comma>. Satellites that light the dead darkness of your vacuum.. Your body bleeds in infrared.. . The shadow and the flame run from another.. The river calm and tame sits above the undercurrents.. . Relish in the sound.. The weightless words the heart attracts.. I want it all; no<comma> I want you back; the period a long ellipse.. You can lose the weight but it all comes back,sad.
Bass in your face. Not an eight track. Gettin' it good to the wood. So the people. Give you some a dat. Reactin' to the fax. That I kick and it stick. And it stay around. Pointin' to the joint<comma> put the Buddha down. Goin'<comma> goin'<comma> gettin' to the roots. Ain't givin' it up. So turn me loose. But then again I got a story. That's harder than the hardcore. Cost of the holocaust. I'm talin' 'bout the one still goin' on. I know. Where I'm from<comma> not dum diddie dum. From the base motherland. The place of the drum. Invaded by the wack diddie wack. Fooled the black<comma> left us faded. King and chief probably had a big beef. Because of dat now I grit my teeth. So here's a song to the strong. 'Bout a shake of a snake. And the smile went along wit dat. Can't truss it. Kickin' wicked rhymes. Like a fortune teller. 'Cause the wickedness done by Jack. Where everybody at. Divided and sold. For liquor and the gold. Smacked in the back. For the other man to mack. Now the story that I'm kickin' is gory. Little Rock where they be. Dockin' this boat. No hope I'm shackled. Plus gang tackled. By the other hand swingin' the rope. Wearin' red<comma> white and blue Jack and his crew. The guy's authorized beat down for the brown. Man to the man<comma> each one so it teach one. Born to terrorize sisters and every brother. One love who said it. I know Whodini sang it. But the hater taught hate. That's why we gang bang it. Beware of the hand. When it's comin' from the left. I ain't trippin' just watch ya step. Can't truss it. An I judge everyone<comma> one by the one. Look here come the judge. Watch it here he come now. I can only guess what's happ'nin'. Years ago he woulda been. The ships captain. Gettin' me bruised on a cruise. What I got to lose<comma> lost all contact. Got me layin' on my back. Rollin' in my own leftover. When I roll over<comma> I roll over in somebody else's. 90 F--kin' days on a slave ship. Count 'em fallin' off 2<comma> 3<comma> 4 hun'ed at a time. Blood in the wood and it's mine. I'm chokin' on spit feelin' pain. Like my brain bein' chained. Still gotta give it what I got. But it's hot in the day<comma> cold in the night. But I thrive to survive<comma> I pray to god to stay alive. Attitude boils up inside. And that ain't it (think I'll every quit). Still I pray to get my hands 'round. The neck of the man wit' the whip. 3 months pass<comma> they brand a label on my ass. To signify. Owned. I'm on the microphone. Sayin' 1555. How I'm livin'. We been livin' here. Livin' ain't the word. I been givin'. Haven't got. Classify us in the have-nots. Fightin' haves. 'Cause it's all about money. When it comes to Armageddon. Mean I'm getting mine. Here I am turn it over Sam. 427 to the year. Do you understand. That's why it's hard. For the black to love the land. Once again. Bass in your face. Not an eight track. Gettin' it good to the wood.

Blue textures cascade downward to the base of the monolith. Like brush strokes on a canvas of souls. Two arms reach out a cloak of silent nihil. Revenants untouched by the scythe. They are lost in the dark woods of time. . Aloft in the landscape that you hail. I am the fog that seeps over here in the early hours. . Standing proud in the hollow of the land. A vestige of deeper purity etched in spirit agaisnt the sky. . The menhir had runes carved in limbs of oaken sovereignty. and could see the ages growing from within the palms. I can feel the era slipping into oblivion<comma>. no longer grasping the textures. I am slowly becoming stone. . As wolves celebrate the dusk<comma>. an old voice of wisdom haunts the vale. . Shapes flicker in the fire light through the windows. The woodlands burn with grace. Their silence drowns the age. . As wandering ghosts pass through the flames. A new age of rebirth lights the dawn. . But who are they who pass by the window?. The shapes; like black solar wheels scorched in the snow. by gods of the stone.... This elder stone shall never fall!. . Cast the aeons into the void. So that no other can seek them. No age<comma> no hands shall taint them. Pour the sorrows into the sun. They are lost forever in dark woods of time. Carve the symbols into the stone. So that another can find them. No age<comma> no hands shall change them. Pour the ages into the sun.

(Chorus x15). Make you feel that way. . (Verse One). Up an early for the hope of a brand new day. See a homie you ain't seen since back in the day. Fresh haircut fitted wit a fat ass fade. End of work<comma> we chilling on a Saturday. How you felt when you first heard the data came. Rakim KRS hey I had that tape. Cooling out with ol girl on a fat ass date. Find a hundred dollar bill wow man that's great. Get promoted at your job up to management. Plot a long time finally a plan has made it. Time I feel I wanna shout<comma> man its real that way. Wanna think of things that make you feel that way. . (Chorus x15). . (Verse Two). Christmas day when your mamma got your first bike. Type of feeling when you went and when your first fight. How your team felt winning championship games. Celebrate in a huddle dancing in this rain. Have a thought see a shooting star cross your screen. Put in hard work finally your living your dream. Deaf man get his hearing now in come vibes. Blind man get sight see his first sunrise . Dumb man speaking out<comma> now he's load and clear. Earth through your chout smile so proud ya wear. Going in your third eye for the styles ya hear. Making music that'll bump for a thousand years. Eating right feeling conscience like health is first.

In the dark it's more likely that you notice light. In the light more likely that you notice night. Hungry more appreciation for that meal. Dead broke more appreciation for that grill. A bad day'll make you really notice ones that's good. And that'll make things a little better understood. Times I feel I wanna shout<comma> man it's real that way. When I think of things that make you feel that way. Make you feel that way.... . (Ya know its like ahh like the most greatest feeling you could ever feel. you like just total illation. Sunny day<comma> just that day.. You know its just like you know just the most joyous feeling. you could ever comprehend. You know<comma> chilling with your family..

We only answer to ourselves . Answer to ourselves . Why does my sleep tell me of lies . Waking life full of rotten surprise . Why do all the strangers care . Who knows who is there . If you are here and I am where? . Trapped in the cell of your own brain . Blood is scarcely moving through your shriveled veins . Don't let yourself pass you by . It can happen in the blink of an eye . There'll be no bad dreams . When you're lying next to me . I don't care about the rules . We only answer to ourselves . Until we fall awake . I feel old now you seem young . I spent too much time out in the sun . I got a wrinkle to show for every day . Give 'em back to me again . I'll spend them the same,calm.

They ask to be preserved. . I was ashamed and mute. Fumbling around for my parachute. Then gliding through the rain. Not a drop could leave its stain. And the world drifting farther away,lonely.

Esta è la storia verdadera de sombrero. caballero della pampa. amigo del pueblo amigo de dios. andale manito ermano con coraje e corazon. nacque già sopra un cavallo. aveva un fucile e un mantello nero. lo chiamarono Pedro Felippe. però per la gente è solo Sombrero. teneva timore de Dios. e il pelo cortato e il cuore caliente. viveva sempre da solo. col suo sombrero ma amava la gente. e sparava correva rideva giocava. cantava una canzone. una storia di sangue una storia d'amore. quando sparava era fermo. la mano sicura puntava al cuore. rubava ma solo per dare. la roba del ricco al povero nero. nessuno l'ha mai incontrato. ma ogni peone ama solo Sombrero. e sparava correva giocava barava. forse cercava un amigo. una birra un mantello o chissà che altra cosa. si seppe molto più tardi. Sombrero cantava e cercava una sposa. sembra che erano in dieci. quel giorno a seguire nella pampa Sombrero. un colpo di fuoco nel cuore. spezzò la vita del caballero. che amava soffriva rideva moriva. nessuno l'ha visto morire. per questo la gente sa che non è vero. negli occhi di chi ha sofferto. c'è una speranza un amico Sombrero. e cantando le sue canzoni. le storie di sangue le storie d'amore. anche se lui non c'è più. ha lasciato al paese un po' del suo cuore.,funny.
Eu quis cantar. Minha canção iluminada de sol. Soltei os panos sobre os mastros no ar. Soltei os tigres e os leões nos quintais. Mas as pessoas na sala de jantar. São ocupadas em nascer e morrer. . Mandei fazer de puro aço. luminoso um punhal. Para matar o meu amor e matei. Às cinco horas na avenida Central. Mas as pessoas na sala de jantar. São ocupadas em nascer e morrer. . Mandei plantar. Folhas de sonho no jardim do solar. As folhas sabem procurar pelo sol. E as raízes procurar<comma> procurar. Mas as pessoas na sala de jantar. Essas pessoas na sala de jantar. São as pessoas da sala de jantar. Mas as pessoas na sala de jantar. São ocupadas em nascer e morrer. . Essas pessoas na sala de jantar. Essas pessoas na sala de jantar.

So I won't run away like I used to do. . Pictures in a box at home. Yellowing and green with mold. So I can barely see your face. Wonder how that color taste. . You were always so far away.

Heart-broken and attractive. A sad<comma> sloppy mess. Lookin' for approval. And easily impressed. Beware they say<comma> but why would I listen?. I need to know what I've been missing.

Call it fate or true love<comma> never forced romance. Fell into a new love. Maybe perfect love by chance. Beware they say<comma> but why would I listen. When it feels this good?. No one lives their life. Doing all the things they say they should. Confusion turns me upside down. Lost as quickly as I'm found. But soon enough it turns around. On the rebound (X4),energetic.

He opens his eyes falls in love at first sight. With the girl in the doorway. What beautiful lines and how full of life. After thousands of years what a face to wake up to. He holds back a sigh as she touches his arm. She dusts off the bed where 'til now he's been sleeping. And under miles of stone<comma> the dried fig of his heart. Under scarab and bone starts back to its beating. . She carries him home in a beautiful boat. He watches the sea from a porthole in stowage. He can hear all she says as she sits by his bed. And one day his lips answer her in her own language. The days quickly pass he loves making her laugh. The first time he moves it's her hair that he touches. She asks<comma> “Are you cursed?” He says<comma> “I think that I'm cured”. Then he talks of the Nile and the girls in bulrushes. . In New York he is laid in a glass covered case. He pretends he is dead people crowd round to see him. But each night she comes round and the two wander down. The halls of the tomb that she calls a museum. Often he stops to rest but then less and less. Then it's her that looks tired staying up asking questions. He learns how to read from the papers that she. Is writing about him and he makes corrections. . It's his face on her book more and more come to look. Families from Iowa<comma> upper west siders. Then one day it's too much he decides to get up. And as chaos ensues he walks outside to find her. She's using a cane and her face looks too pale. But she's happy to see him as they walk he supports her. She asks<comma> “Are you cursed?” but his answer's obscured. In a sandstorm of flashbulbs and rowdy reporters. . Such reanimation the two tour the nation. He gets out of limos he meets other women. He speaks of her fondly their nights in the museum. But she's just one more rag now he's dragging behind him. She stops going out she just lies there in bed. In hotels in whatever towns they are speaking. Then her face starts to set and her hands start to fold. And one day the dried fig of her heart stops its beating. . Long ago on the ship she asked<comma> “Why pyramids?”. He said<comma> “Think of them as an immense invitation”. She asked<comma> “Are you cursed?” He said<comma> “I think that I'm cured”. Then he kissed her and hoped that she'd forget that question,sad.

He is looking out the window. At somebody coming in. . "It is always nice to see you". Says the man behind the counter. To the woman who has come in. She is shaking her umbrella. . And I look the other way. As they are kissing their hellos. I'm pretending not to see them. And instead I pour the milk. . I open up the paper. There's a story of an actor. Who had died while he was drinking. It was no one I had heard of. . And I'm turning to the horoscope. And looking for the funnies. When I'm feeling someone watching me. And so I raise my head. . There's a woman on the outside. Looking inside . Does she see me?. No she does not really see me. 'Cause she sees her own reflection. . And I'm trying not to notice. That she's hitching up her skirt. And while she's straightening her stockings. Her hair has gotten wet. . Oh<comma> this rain it will continue. Through the morning as I'm listening. To the bells of the cathedral. I am thinking of your voice.... . And of the midnight picnic. Once upon a time. Before the rain began.... . I finish up my coffee. It's time to catch the train,calm.

I got a letter from the government. The other day. I opened and read it. It said they were suckers. They wanted me for their army or whatever. Picture me given' a damn - I said never. Here is a land that never gave a damn. About a brother like me and myself. Because they never did. I wasn't wit' it<comma> but just that very minute.... It occured to me. The suckers had authority. Cold sweatin' as I dwell in my cell. How long has it been?. They got me sittin' in the state pen. I gotta get out - but that thought was thought before. I contemplated a plan on the cell floor. I'm not a fugitive on the run. But a brother like me begun - to be another one. Public enemy servin' time - they drew the line y'all. To criticize me some crime - never the less. They could not understand that I'm a Black man. And I could never be a veteran. On the strength<comma> the situation's unreal. I got a raw deal<comma> so I'm goin' for the steel. . They got me rottin' in the time that I'm servin'. Tellin' you what happened the same time they're throwin'. 4 of us packed in a cell like slaves - oh well. The same motherfucker got us livin' is his hell. You have to realize - what its a form of slavery. Organized under a swarm of devils. Straight up - word'em up on the level. The reasons are several<comma> most of them federal. Here is my plan anyway and I say. I got gusto<comma> but only some I can trust - yo. Some do a bid from 1 to 10. And I never did<comma> and plus I never been. I'm on a tier where no tears should ever fall. Cell block and locked - I never clock it y'all. 'Cause time and time again time. They got me servin' to those and to them. I'm not a citizen. But ever when I catch a C-O. Sleepin' on the job - my plan is on go-ahead. On the strength<comma> I'ma tell you the deal. I got nothin' to lose. 'Cause I'm goin' for the steel. . You know I caught a C-O. Fallin' asleep on death row. I grabbed his gun - then he did what I said so. And everyman's got served. Along with the time they served. Decency was deserved. To understand my demands. I gave a warnin' - I wanted the governor<comma> y'all. And plus the warden to know. That I was innocent -. Because I'm militant. Posing a threat<comma> you bet it's fuckin' up the government. My plan said I had to get out and break north. Just like with Oliver's neck. I had to get off - my boys had the feds in check. They couldn't do nuthin'. We had a force to instigate a prison riot. This is what it takes for peace. So I just took the piece. Black for Black inside time to cut the leash. Freedom to get out - to the ghetto - no sell out. 6 C-Os we got we ought to put their head out. But I'll give 'em a chance<comma> cause I'm civilized. As for the rest of the world<comma> they can't realize. A cell is hell - I'm a rebel so I rebel. Between bars<comma> got me thinkin' like an animal. Got a woman C-O to call me a copter. She tried to get away<comma> and I popped her. Twice<comma> right. Now who wanna get nice?. I had 6 C-Os<comma> now it's 5 to go. And I'm serious - call me delirious. But I'm still a captive. I gotta rap this. Time to break as time grows intense. I got the steel in my right hand. Now I'm lookin' for the fence. . I ventured into the courtyard. Followed by 52 brothers. Bruised<comma> battered<comma> and scarred but hard. Goin' out with a bang. Ready to bang out. But power from the sky. And from the tower shots rang out. A high number of dose - yes. And some came close. Figure I trigger my steel. Stand and hold my post. This is what I mean - an anti-nigger machine. If I come out alive and then they won't - come clean. And then I threw up my steel bullets - flew up. Blew up<comma> who shot.... What<comma> who<comma> the bazooka was who. And to my rescue<comma> it was the S1Ws. Secured my getaway<comma> so I just gotaway. The joint broke<comma> from the black smoke. Then they saw it was rougher thatn the average bluffer. 'Cause the steel was black<comma> the attitude exact. Now the chase is on tellin' you to c'mon. 53 brothers on the run<comma> and we are gone,angry.

I lose some sales and my boss won't be happy . But I can't stop listening to the sound . Of two soft voices rendered in perfection . From the reels of this record that I found . Every day there's a boy in the mirror . Asking me what are you doing here . Finding all my previous motives . Growing increasingly unclear . . I've travelled far and I've burned all the bridges . I believed as soon as I hit land. All the other options held before me . Will wither in the light of my plan . So I lose some sales and my boss won't be happy. But there's only one thing on my mind . Searching boxes underneath the counter . On a chance that on a tape I'd find . A song for . Someone who needs somewhere . To long for . . Homesick . Cause I no longer know . Where home is,sleepy.

In the bright red sky. In the heat of an evening. When only prisoners sleep. She said she couldn't. Come to the garden. See an old man wheel. . She said her dreams. What too far to be thought of. As scars too white to view. She said she couldn't. Come to the garden. See a blind man kneel. . She sailed away. To a blue horizon. In floating thoughts she'd sway. She said she couldn't. Come to the garden. See an old man pray. . She wished them luck. As they left on their journey. Maybe she'd join them soon. But she lost her grip. At the tip of life's finger. Went home and worshipped the moon,lonely.

We're so far away from home. Where we belong. . I'm not afraid now of the dark anymore. And many mountains now are molehills. Back in Berlin they're all well fed. I don't care. People always bored me anyway,calm.

It's been a long and lonely trip but I'm glad that I took it because it was well worth it.. I got to read a couple books and do some research before I reached my verdict.. Never thought that I was perfect. Always thought that I had a purpose.. Used to wonder if I'd live to see my first kiss.. . The most difficult thing I ever did was recite my own words at a service. Realizing the person I was addressing probably wasn't looking down from heaven.. Or cooking up something in hell's kitchen<comma> trying to listen in or eaves drop from some another dimension.. It was self serving just like this is.. . Conveniently religious on Easter Sunday and on Christmas.. The television went from being a babysitter to a mistress.. Technology made it easy for us to stay in touch while keeping a distance<comma>. 'til we just stayed distant and never touched. Now all we do is text too much.. . I don't remember much from my youth. Maybe my memory is repressed.. Or I just spent too much time wondering if I'd live to have sex.. Fell in love for the first time in 4th grade but I didn't have the courage to talk to her.. In 8th grade I wrote her the note but I slipped it in someone else's locker.. . Considered killing myself 'cause of that.. It was a big deal. It was a blown cover.. It was over for me. My goose was cooked.. Stick a fork in me. The jig is up.. I blew my chances<comma> the rest is history<comma> our future was torn asunder.. It became abundantly clear that I was only brought here to suffer.. . At least I didn't include my name.. Thankfully I wrote the whole note in code. And it had 10 layers of scotch tape safety seal making it impossible to open.. Plus<comma> it was set to self destruct.. Whoever read it probably died…laughing.. I wonder if they lived long enough to realize what happened.. . A year later<comma> I came to understand that wasn't love that I was feeling for her.. I had someone else to obsess over.. I was older. I was very mature.. I forged my time signature while practicing my parents autograph 'cause I was failing math.. Disconnected the phone when I thought the teacher would call my home.. . I checked the mailbox twice a day at the end of a long dirt road.. Steamed open a couple envelopes like I was in private detective mode.. If you snoop around long enough for something in particular you're guaranteed to find it.. For better or worse that's how I learned that it's best to just keep some things private.. . It was the best of times. It was the end of times.. . It was the best of times. It was the end of times.. I was always on deck<comma> I was next in line.. An only child with a pen and pad writing a list of things that I could never have.. The walls in my house were paper thin.. Every squabble seemed to get deafening.. If my memory serves me correctly I made it a point to void and forget some things.. Probably to keep from being embarrassed.. Never meant to upset or give grief to my parents.. Kept my secrets…hid my talents…. In my head<comma> never under the mattress.. . Therapy couldn't break me.. Never learned a word that would insure safety.. So I spoke softly and I tip toed often.. The door to my room was like a big old coffin.. The way that it creeked when I closed it shut.. Anxieties peaked when it opened up.. As if everything that I was thinking would be exposed.. I still sleep fully clothed.. . It was the best of times.. . It was beautiful.. It was brutal.. It was cruel.. It was business as usual.. . Heaven. It was hell.. Used to wonder if I'd live to see 12.. . When I did I figured that I was immortal.. Loved to dance but couldn't make it to the formal.. Couldn't bear watching my imaginary girlfriend. Bust a move with any other dudes.. . Tone Loc was talking bout a "Wild Thang". But I was still caught up in some child thangs.. Scared of a God who couldn't spare the rod.. It was clearly a brimstone and fire thang.. . Pyromaniac. Kleptomaniac.. Couldn't explain my desire to steal that fire.. Now I add it to my rider.. Like "Please oh please don't throw me in that patch of brier!". . It was the best of times. It was the end of times.. . The school counselor was clueless 'cause I never skipped classes.. Perfect attendance. Imperfect accent.. Speech impediment they could never really fix. And I faked bad eyesight so I could wear glasses.. . Considered doing something that would cripple me.. I wanted a wheelchair. I wanted the sympathy.. I wanted straight teeth so then came braces.. 4 years of head gear helped me change faces.. . It was the best of times. It was the end of times.. . Now I wonder if I'll live to see marriage.. Wonder if I'll live long enough to have kids.. Wonder if I'll live to see my kids have kids.. If I do I'm gonna tell 'em how it is.. . "Don't listen when they tell you that these are your best years.. Don't let anybody protect your ears.. It's best that you hear what they don't want you to hear.. It's better to have pressure from peers than not have peers.. Beer won't give you chest hair. Spicy food won't make it curl.. When you think you've got it all figured out and then everything collapses…. Trust me<comma> kid…it's not the end of the world.",lonely.

It's been a long time since I wore this rattle snake smile. And a lot of my friends haven't seen it in quite a while. I feel my eyes rolling deep inside my head. And there's a feeling of misconception in the air. Yeah<comma> I'm starting to see. Yeah<comma> I do believe. I used to have a soft southern glowing face.

It's been two years since I've taken this way home. It's comforting to know not much has changed. From the fields we used to roam to sneak into those two abandoned homes. . Everyone's a writer I just have a general block.... There's signs in every yard. But a piece of plastic doesn't tend to make my mind. . I still take bad advice from my best friends. Rather take bad advice from my best friends. And guide a sinking ship to the bottom with them. I'll go to the bottom with you. . Thinking back on thinking forward.

Sometimes I can't believe the things I get myself into. Because laying low has never made much sense to me. . So keep on spinning and I'll stay behind. My closing speech.... Fuck your world<comma> I'll take mine. (Sincerely stolen from a bathroom wall),energetic.

It's early in the morning. Today I'm moving away. Sitting here for the last time. Makes me feel so strange. . My life here has ended. Like a pulled up weed. Don't play no sad songs. They'll make me cry. . This situation reminds me. Of when I went away to school. My friends they all called me. And said I've been made a fool. . My girlfriend she left me. For my best friend. Oh don't play no sad songs. They'll make me cry. . Coz sad songs are tearing up my heart again. Loneliness is standing in my path again. Oh<comma> I can feel it coming.

I was wielding my axe dunk whisky at the bar every night coming home out of the windshield of my car. I would look through the boughs and think I saw my lucky star.. I was spreading my sheets took dinner all alone every night of the week awaiting by the phone. And I'd dab off my tears with my favorite pine cone.. Needle prick my spruce root. Dear little hemlock shoot. Make me stay sharp and keen<comma> evergreen.. I would tend to my bees sell honey on the road every fall in the wet watching lorries take their load. And I'd get all my winnings ask for special sap in code. In August for three weeks I'm back in the village where I clip all sorts of brambles and thorns from up the hill I pip. In a little clay cup the stuff I cross myself and sip.. Needle prick my spruce root. Dear little hemlock shoot. Make me stay sharp and keen<comma> evergreen..

I went away to see an old friend of mine. His sister came over she was out of her mind. She said Jesus had a twin who knew nothing about sin. She was laughing like crazy at the trouble I'm in. Her light eyes were dancing she is insane. Her brother says she's just a bitch with a golden chain. She keeps coming closer saying "I can feel it in my bones. Schizophrenia is taking me home". My future is static. It's already had it. I could tuck you in. And we can talk about it. I had a dream. And it split the scene. But I got a hunch. It's coming back to me,angry.
I went out walking the other day. The wind hung wet around my neck. My head it rung with screams and groans. From the night I spent amongst her bones. I passed beside the mission house. Where that mad old buzzard<comma> the reverend<comma>. Shrieked and flapped about life after you're dead. Well<comma> I thought about my friend<comma> Michel. How they rolled him in linoleum. And shot him in the neck. A bloody halo<comma> like a think-bubble. Circling his head. And I bellowed at the firmament. Looks like the rains are hear to stay. And the rain pissed down upon me. And washed me all away. Saying. . Papa won't leave you<comma> Henry. Papa won't leave you<comma> Boy. Papa won't leave you<comma> Henry. Papa won't leave you<comma> Boy. Well<comma> the road is long. And the road is hard. And many fall by the side. But Papa won't leave you<comma> Henry. So there ain't no need to cry. . And I went on down the road. He went on down the road. And I went on down the road. He went on down the road. . Well<comma> the moon it looked exhausted. Like something you should pity. Spent an age-spotted. Above the sizzling wires of the city. Well<comma> it reminded me of her face. Her bleached and hungry eyes. Her hair was like a curtain. Falling open with the laughter. And closing with the lies. But the ghost of her still lingers on. Though she's passed through me. And is gone. The slum dogs<comma> they are barking. And the rain children on the streets. And the tears that we will weep today. Will all be washed away. By the tears that we will weep again tomorrow. . Papa won't leave you<comma> Henry. Papa won't leave you<comma> Boy. Papa won't leave you<comma> Henry. Papa won't leave you<comma> Boy.

And I went on down the road. He went on down the road. . And I came upon a little house. A little house upon a hill. And I entered through<comma> the curtain hissed. Into the house with its blood-red bowels. Where wet-lipped women with greasy fists. Crawled the ceilings and the walls. They filled me full of drink. And led me round the rooms. Naked and cold and grinning. Until everything went black. And I came down spinning. I awoke so drunk and full of rage. That I could hardly speak. A fag in a whale-bone corset. Draping his dick across my cheek. And its into the shame. And its into a guilt. And its into the fucking fray. And the walls ran red around me. A warm arterial spray. Saying. . Papa won't leave you<comma> Henry. Papa won't leave you<comma> Boy. Papa won't leave you<comma> Henry. Papa won't leave you<comma> Boy. Well<comma> the night is dark. And the night is deep.

He went on down the road. . It's the rainy season where I'm living. Death comes leaping out of every doorway. Wasting you for money<comma> for your clothes. And for your nothing. Entire towns being washed away. Favelas exploding on inflammable spillways. Lynch-mobs<comma> death squads<comma> babies being born without brains. The mad heat and the relentless rains. And if you stick your arm into that hole. It comes out sheared off to the bone. And with her kisses bubbling on my lips. I swiped the rain and nearly missed. And I went on down the road. He went on down the road. Singing. . Papa won't leave you<comma> Henry. Papa won't leave you<comma> Boy. Papa won't leave you<comma> Henry. Papa won't leave you<comma> Boy. Well<comma> the road is long. And the road is hard. And many fall by the side. But Papa won't leave you<comma> Henry. So there ain't no need to cry. . And I went on down the road.

I will rise now. And go about the city. In the street's. Broadways I seek. Him whom my soul loveth. . Went over the sea. What did I find?. A thousand crystal towers. A hundred emerald cities. . And the hand of the watchman. In the night sky. Points to my beloved. A knight in crystal armour. . And I tried to hold him. I tried for the creed. I'll make a suit of colours. To stop the blinding mirrors. . Saw a cape of red and gold. Stifle up the being. With the perfect armour. With a perfect dream. . To be made of glass. When two suns are shining. The battle becomes blinding. To be made of glass. But we ride tonight<comma> tonight<comma> tonight<comma> we ride. . And with two suns spinning. At two different speeds. Was born a hot white diamond. Burning through the rainbow. . Flames fell into orbit. To hold eternally. Two heavenly spirits. That just wouldn't seem. . To be made of glass.

I woke up this morning . With a bad hangover . And my penis was missing again. . This happens all the time. It's detachable. . This comes in handy a lot of the time. I can leave it home . When I think it's going to get me in trouble. Or I can rent it out. When I don't need it. . But now and then I go to a party. Get drunk. And the next morning I can't for the life of me. Remember what I did with it.. . First I looked around my apartment . And I couldn't find it . So I called up the place where the party was. They hadn't seen it either. .

I called some other people from the party . But they were no help either. . I was starting to get desperate. I really don't like being without my penis for too long. It makes me feel like less of a man. And I really hate having to sit down every time I take a leak. . After a few hours of searching the house. And calling everyone I could think of. I was starting to get very depressed. So I went to the Kiev and ate breakfast. . Then as I walked down Second Avenue . Towards St. Mark's place. Where all those people sell used books. And other junk on the street. I saw my penis lying on a blanket . Next to a broken toaster oven. Some guy was selling it. . I had to buy it off him . He wanted 22 bucks. But I talked him down to 17. . I took it home<comma> washed it off. And put it back on. I was happy again. Complete. . People sometimes tell me I should get it permanently attached.

Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride. I'm running and I won't touch ground . Oh-no<comma> I got to keep on moving. . Never let another girl like you<comma> work me over.

Last night these two bouncers and one of 'em's alright<comma> the other one's the scary one. His way or no way<comma> totalitarian. He's got no time for you looking or breathing how he don't want you to. So step out the queue<comma> he makes examples of you. And there's naught you can say. Behind they go through to the bit where you pay. And you realise then that it's finally the time. To walk back past ten thousand eyes in the line. And you can swap jumpers and make another move. Instilled in your brain you've got something to prove. To all the smirking faces and the boys in black. Why can't they be pleasant? Why can't they have a laugh?. He's got his hand in your chest<comma> he wants to give you a duff. Well<comma> secretly I think they want it all to kick off. They want arms flying everywhere and bottles as well. It's just something to talk about<comma> a story to tell you. . Well<comma> I'm so glad they turned us all away<comma> we'll put it down to fate. I said a thousand million things that I could never say this morning. Got too deep but how deep is too deep?. . Well<comma> this town's a different town today.

Music is my sanctuary. Music is my blanket. . Emotionless the city lies. Cruel it is<comma> it clouds my eyes. The dull the dark shades on my day. I live inside this place. .

I see only what i wanna see. I'll be only what i wanna be. My blanket covers me<comma> yes. . "Yeah<comma> check it. Now as a yout man I was body poppin breakin on the lino. Traded in my lino for a pad and a biro. Used to stand in line just so as I could sign my giro. But now my ends meet in the best way that I know. (Hat<comma> snare<comma> kick) and the beats that go boom. See the music I consume to escape the doom and gloom. All the beats and melodies keep realities at bay. But what happens when the records done and starts to fade away". . Alone within myself again. I try to veil away my pain. The dirty grey surrounding me 'round. And now I hear no sound.... . "I feel like Melle Mel from way back in the days. As i wonder how i keep from going under. I got trouble on my mind like my name is chuck d. And like marvin gaye it makes me wanna holler. When the music hits me I feel no pain. That's why i gotta put you on again and again. I take the needle off the technics and put it in my vein. All my troubles get crushed as the rush hits my brain. And away goes trouble down the drain". . I see only what I wanna see. I be only who I wanna be. My blanket covers me. Music is my sanctuary. Music is my blanket. I see only what I wanna see. I be only who I wanna be. My blanket covers me. Music is my sanctuary. Music is my blanket. You are my living world. You are my living world. You are you are you are my. My only living world....,sexy.

My mother was a Chinese trapeze artist in pre-war Paris . Smuggling bombs for the underground. And she met my father at a fete in Aix-en-Provence. He was disguised as a Russian cadet in the employ of the Axis.  . And there in the half-light of the provincial midnight . To a lone concertina they drank in cantinas . And toasted to Edith Piaf and the fall of the Reich. . My sister was born in a hovel in Burgundy . And left for the cattle but later was found by a communist. Who had deserted his ranks to follow his dream . To start up a punk rock band in South Carolina. . And I get letters sometimes<comma> they bought a plantation . She weeds the tobacco<comma> he offends the nation . And they write<comma> "Don't be a stranger<comma> y'hear? . Sincerely<comma> your sister.". . So my parents had me to the disgust of the prostitutes . On a bed in a brothel<comma> surprisingly raised with tender care . Til the money got tight and they bet me away . To a blind brigadier in a game of high stakes canasta. . But he made me a sailor on his brigadier ship fleet. I know every yardarm from main mast to jib sheet. But sometimes I long to be landlocked . And to work in a bakery,sad.

Our address was in the sky. Just a roof of woven reeds. You and I. On the highest front. Of a very tall tree. . Months and months we'd stay up high. Because all the climbing takes such time. And we'd live on the blooms carried in by the breeze. . Every night I'd promise you. We'd go down to see the friends we once knew. But every night I'd make an excuse. . And I never came down from the roof. I awoke and you had flown. Just an impression of you next to me. And the terrible sound of the clapping of leaves. . Every night I'd promise you. We'd go down to see the friends we once knew. But every night I'd make an excuse. And I never came down from the roof.,calm.

We sing<comma> <i>"Is that marionette real enough yet. To step off of that set to decide what her hands might be doing?. Ruining the play<comma> to in the ensuing melee escape."</i>. . We packed up all of our bags. The ship's deck now sags from the weight of our tracks. As we pace beneath flags black and battered. Rattling our swords in service of some faded foreign lord. . And we sail out on orders from him but we find. The maps he sent to us don't mention lost coastlines. Where nothing we've actually seen has been mapped or outlined. And we don't recognize the names upon these signs. . And every night finds us rocking and rolling on waves wild and white. Well<comma> we have lost our way<comma> nobody's gonna say it outright. Just go la la la la la la la la la.... Oh<comma> la la la la la la la la la la la.... Oh<comma> oh<comma> oh. . La la la la la la. La la la la la. La la la la la la,sexy.

[Posdonus]. Up in them five-star tellies and two mic rhymes. be them average MC's of the times. Unlike them<comma> we craft gems. So systematically inclined to pen lines. without sayin a producer's name<comma> all over the track. Yeah I said it! What you need to do is get back. to reading credits<comma> we them medics. alphabetically stuck on that english. And knock it out before we pour. that sure shot more rock co.kane flow. . [MF Doom]. From the top of the key<comma> the 3 Villain. Been on in the game as long as you can wheelie your Schwinn. Turn the corner spinnin<comma> bust that ass and get up. Dust off the mask<comma> whoever laugh give him a head up. He got jumped<comma> it pumped his adrenaline. He said it made him tougher than a bump of raw medicine. To write all night long<comma> the hourglass is still slow. Flow from Hellborn to Free Power like Wilco. And still owe bills<comma> pay dues forever. Slay huge when it comes to who's more cleverer. Use to wore a leather goose ski with a fur collar. Hand charged a fee for loose leaf words for dollar. Ya heard? Holla - broad or dude<comma> we leave food. Eat your team for sure<comma> the streets sure seem rude. For fam like the Partridges<comma> pardon me for the mix-up. Battle for your Atari cartridges or put your kicks up. It's a stick up. . [Dave]. Now put your blix up<comma> these Riddick Bowe cuts. is swoll like penile flicks<comma> give 'em 20. The danger in his eyes'll let you know he's a brawler. Bring your tallest champs like that much taller. Ten pounds heavier<comma> one step ahead of it. Vocab<comma> stamina<comma> style's all irrelevant. Camps and cliques<comma> units<comma> squad crews and clans. Even your tongues'll fuck around and leave your mouth. . [MF Doom]. Doom brung that bum<comma> there goes that news van again.

You slow<comma> you blow the soup on your fools<comma> his Impulse like Yugo. . [Posdonus]. You go lights<comma> camera<comma> action with no makeup. We De La to the death<comma> or at least until we break up. Here's a couple of nice guys who finished first. So nice try<comma> but the prize is ours dispersed. They say the good die young<comma> so I added some. bad-ass to my flavor to prolong my life over the drum. Everyone cools off from bein hot. It's about if you can handle bein cold or not!. And we was told to hop for no one<comma> s'what I dig bout Prince Paul. We stayed original ever since y'all. First to do a lot of things in the game<comma> but the last to say it. No need to place it on a scale to weigh it. And don't do it for the plays or to raise the bar. Yet it's raised anyway<comma> it's so amazing<comma> are. the three L.I. brothers from a other way of thinkin. Hey your lady's winkin<comma> I think you need to control that aura. or I can hold her. . [Dave]. The elements are airborne<comma> I smell the success. (Yo let's cookie cut the shit and get the gingerbread<comma> man). Sacrifice mics and push drugs to these rappers. Puff ponies 'til I turn blue in the lips. Sippin broads like 7-Up (ahh) so refreshing. I think I'll pop these verse like first dates to birthdates. September 2-1<comma> 1-9<comma> 6-8. Too old<comma> should I? Too bad<comma> too late,groovy.
POS: . Greetings<comma> girl<comma> and welcome to my world of phrase . I'm right up to bat . It's a Daisy Age and you're about to walk top-stage . So wipe your Lottos on the mat . Hip-hop love this is and don't mind when I quiz your . Involvements before the sun . But clear your court 'cause this is a one-man sport . And who's better for this than Plug One . Now you don't have to worry about me squashin' other deals . 'Cause they've already been squooshed . Freeze a frame about moods the same which we can continue . Right behind the bush . You'll stay with me . Eye Know this . But not because of all my earthly treasures . Or regardless to the fact that I'm Posdnuos . But because . . (Eye know Eye love you better) . . DOVE: . May I cut this dance to introduce myself as . The chosen one to speak . Let me lay my hand across yours . And aim a kiss upon your cheek . They name's Plug Two . And from the soul I bring you . The Daisy of your choice . May it be filled with the pleasure principle . In circumference to my voice . About those other Jennys I reckoned with . Lost them all like a homework excuse . This time the Magic Number is two . 'Cause it takes two<comma> not three<comma> to seduce . My destiny of love is brought to an apex . Sex is a mere molecule . In this world of love that I have for you . It's true . . (Eye know Eye love you better) . . POS: . Now it's time to let this rhyme style . Get somewhat poured in the mold . Take my hand and we'll pick my plantation . Of Daisies for a bouquet of Soul . Life will begin at the cut of a rim . Take it as filled to the rim as in brim . Squeeze your stoop like Betty Boop . We'll make Campbell's Alphabet Soup . And spell Plug One's within . Forward march is the say . When transistors will play . Come into bed is the mood . Dolby sound will be then top crowned . When I put the needle into your groove . I got a good thing . And in full swing . I show this in gifts<comma> words or letters . But even without those three . Eye know you'll be close to me 'cause . . (Eye know I love you better) . . DOVE: . It's I again and the song that I send . Is taking steps to reach your heart . Any moment you feel alone . I can fill up your empty part . We can ascend 'till we reach De La Heaven . And in a spin we'll hit the Top Ten . Then we will meet Mr Stuckie . And Pos' brother Lucky will preach . Let the wedding begin . Shot by an arrow of cupid . Through the string of a G-clef . My dear<comma> I claim you're def . And if you can hear me<comma> by golly gee<comma> . Trugoy is ready for what you posess . We could live in my Plug Two home . And on Mars where we could be all alone . And we make a song for two<comma> . Picture perfect things and I sing of how . . (Eye know I love you better),happy.

That's me inside your head. That's me inside your head .... . That's me inside your head!,angry.

Pride no longer has definition. Everybody wears it<comma> it always fits. A state invoked for the lack of position. Strength is the bait that keeps us so busy. If it's perforated<comma> then I tear it to bits. All sense lost in the frenzy. They should never touch the ground. Irony is the refuge of the educated. Always complaining but they never quit. Cool's eternal<comma> but it always dated. They should never touch the ground. It's not worth<comma> it's the investment. That keeps us tied up in all these strings. We draw lines and stand behind them. That's why flags are such ugly things. That they should never touch the ground,angry.

Sandy<comma> the fireworks are hailin' over Little Eden tonight. Forcin' a light into all those stony faces left stranded on this warm July. Down in the town<comma> the circuit's full of switchblade lovers<comma> so fast<comma> so shiny<comma> and so sharp. And the wizards play down on Pinball Way on the boardwalk way past dark. And the boys from the casino dance with their shirts open like Latin lovers on the shore. Chasin' all them silly New York virgins by the score. . And<comma> Sandy<comma> the aurora is risin' behind us. These pier lights<comma> our carnival life forever. Oh<comma> love me tonight for I may never see you again. Hey<comma> Sandy<comma> girl.

Them boys in their high heels<comma> ah<comma> Sandy<comma> their skins are so white. And me<comma> I just got tired of hangin' in them dusty arcades<comma> bangin' them pleasure machines. Chasin' the factory girls underneath the boardwalk where they all promise to unsnap their jeans. And you know that tilt-a-whirl down on the South Beach drag?. I got on it last night and my shirt got caught. And they kept me spinnin'<comma> babe<comma> didn't think I'd ever get off. . Oh<comma> Sandy<comma> the aurora is risin' behind us.

My<comma> my<comma> my<comma> my<comma> my baby. . Sandy<comma> that waitress I was seein' lost her desire for me. I spoke with her last night<comma> she said she won't set herself on fire for me anymore. She worked that joint under the boardwalk<comma> she was always the girl you saw boppin' down the beach with the radio. The kids say last night she was dressed like a star in one of them cheap little seaside bars. And I saw her parked with lover boy out on the Kokomo. Did you hear the cops finally busted Madame Marie for tellin' fortunes better than they do?. For me<comma> this boardwalk life's through. Babe<comma> you ought to quit this scene<comma> too. . Sandy<comma> the aurora is rising behind us. This pier lights our carnival life forever. Oh<comma> love me tonight<comma> and I promise I'll love you forever.

Saul Williams:. . Please Mr. Nichols come back inside the window. I can't promise you anything<comma> but I trust that there is far greater reason to live. I know you've become disheartened and disillusioned by the current state of affairs. Your stocks are falling<comma> your investments have failed you. The man from whom you took orders has been ordered to jail by his and your subordinates. You question what is this world coming to. What is the profit margin when you're forced to pander to the marginalized. Where's the glory you dreamt of as a child... Dressed as a cowboy<comma> your play gun pointed at real targets. Your mother<comma> holding her tongue as your father consoles her with the words... “it's just boy stuff”. . Well. You joined his fraternity<comma> you grew into his old suits. You acquired his beliefs<comma> you embodied his dreams and with them his oversights.. How long did you think it would last?. It's just a matter of time.. The world is far from over.. . Look.... Your mother outlives your father<comma>. Your sister outlives your brother.. And if you jump from this window today... She'll also outlive you.. Look at her<comma> sitting in her midwestern home<comma> tuned into Oprah once again. Today<comma> she learns to meditate on a second-hand couch.. Meanwhile<comma> you stand outside this window. Twelve stories above the ground. One story remaining untold.... . You contemplate the setting sun<comma>. Unaware of your disorientation.. Dis-orient: turned away from the east.. The shifting current seems to conspire against you.. Mr. Nichols<comma> you fail to see that you've always stood outside of this window<comma> perched on the threshold of oblivion.. Countless man made stories above the truth. For so long you've stood facing the setting sun. Mistaking the complimentary unified duality of nature as being right or wrong. Good or evil. God or devil. Mr. Nichols instead of stepping from this ledge into the downfall of your up rise. Why not just turn around. Lessen the intensity of your western glare and face the rising sun. Note the energy swirling from its center. How it illumines us all and only the birds fly first class.... . There is your inheritance!. The warmth of a kiss. Invest your tongue into the mouth of mystery. Allow her breath to seep into your lungs and surrender to her touch and guidance. There's no other way. Your dreams of dominance will only help you forsake yourself. While your family continues its search for understanding. And your daughters outlive your sons...,lonely.

Scoot and make as was. Smell come in on the train. Then dunk in sacrone. Left at trow's ennui. All ours anchor. To the aching bone. Programmed without form. Programmed without sound. . Austere known your pen. Throats inside of glass. Hanging next to me. Eyes all disappear. Gloss tones speak in turn. Chew in such a rush. Lands strength a rolling home. Lie doesn't hold mass. . I found myself awake and walking. The two of you arrive. Backs turned to the spitting. But they have not a dream. No one was there. Look towards the face. Becoming very clear,sad.

Seems like I relied too hard on a dream. Now tell me girl where have you really been. Cause I've only got this life right here. Wasted all and contain all the fear.

[Slug]. If I was a rich man. I'd buy you some shoes. Tall boots for all the dirt you walk through. What would that do?. Enable you to deal. Without schooling you on how to touch what's real. And if I was a smart man. I'd tell you everything that I knew. And give it to you every time you need a talking to. But what would that do?. Teach you my guidelines. So you can be a cheerleader at your game on the sidelines. And if I was a driver. I'd keep my headlights on. To see the difference between right and wrong. I'd wear my seatbelt even when I'm in park. Cause I don't trust the other fools that cruise through these parts. And if I was a better cook. I'd hook up a feast. Set a table full of food for the children to eat. I encourage the nourishment so we can breathe. With the knowledge that we got something accomplished. . Chorus:. And if I was Santa Claus<comma> I'd fight for the cause. Wouldn't expect nothing in return. I'd give you everything you want<comma> I'd be everything you need. So you can take my hand and I can take the lead. . And if I was an honest man.

And if I was you<comma> I wouldn't hear a word I said. Wouldn't trust nothing to start it up inside my head. I'd make a conscious effort to live instead. Of trying to kill the monsters that reside underneath the bed. And if I was a hurt man. I'd find a way to put my faith . Into a woman that could take me from today. Maybe. I need somebody that could save me. From the parts of myself that keep making me crazy. And if I was a wise man. I'd climb to the top of the mountain peak. To think about strength versus weakness. I'd find a point that rests a couple of feet above your head. And figure out how I could try to help you reach it. (Ho ho ho). And if I did have a choice. I'd never want to live forever. Just let me have a voice so I can make my points. I can't imagine running a race with no finish line. Just let me keep my pace and make to most of my time. I love giving but I'm bad at receiving. The truth is<comma> I'd prefer to be the one bleeding. But I'm a paranoid that stays between play and work. Cautious and aware<comma> 'cause I'm afraid of being hurt. Which brings me to the issue. And that would be this:. How often must I ask myself why I exist?. I feel like a freak<comma> this world is a circus. Just trying to find myself as well as my purpose. . Chorus:. And if I was Santa Claus<comma> I'd fight for the cause. Wouldn't expect nothing in return. I'd give you everything you want<comma> I'd be everything you need. And you can take my hand and I can take the lead (2x). . I got nothing but gifts. Keep it up in my wits. Got me drunk on the fifth. And now we're stuck in a ditch. And as dumb as it gets. I'mma run you some fibs (?). I wanna touch your lips. I wanna rub your hips. Put a glove on the fist. For the love that exists. We'll keep bumping the hits. To get my bucket of chips. From the Bloods and the Crips. To the skateboarding chicks. Put the Atmosphere on your Christmas wishlist (2x). (Ho ho ho ho),funny.

So I said<comma> man pull her out of the water. And then<comma> lay on hands and bind back her flippers and tail. Until international waters. And there we'll feel. All that's human inside of her. . So she's chilly and slick. On her hips where the scales meet with skin. With a sickening flick of her tail. Circling her gills filled with cold salty water. And she thrashes and twirls. Her freezing fins fluttering. . But she's pretty I think. With her hair dark as ink. And her belly bone-white. And her lips of a slight seashell pink. Lightly part as she's tonguing the tub's rusty rim. As the salt water it flows out again. . Oh<comma> farewell is to the land we know well. We'll never be touching again. To fields where we rambled and ran. Farewell to our wives and children. Let's stand on the deck and let's watch. Them all disappearing. . And the days all float by. And the days over waves under sky. And the weeks slowly leak into years. The last islands are all left behind. As we silently sail. Until late some dark night a wild wind starts to wail. And our map blows away. And our compasses fail. And it's out on the lost boiling black water where. I see her float out. She's so thin and so pale. I see her rise up. She's so fast and so fair. My hands meet and they press to a point in the air. But my mouth fills with more panic than prayer. And my skull fills with more colour than care. And my heart fills with love<comma> with too much love to bear. And I know that I'll stay<comma> that she'll always be there. My hands suck in cold<comma> sad seaweed strung through her hair,sad.

Solå står I zenith og håve henge lågt. I Gruvene på 16 er me I samme båt. Ved foten av fjellet kan du sjå me går. I takt med lenker rundt halsen<comma> år etter år. . Alt me fire ner I sjaktå av gull og grøn smaragd. Havne rett I fanget på Henry blir det sagt. Det dryppe ikkje på oss. Me trenge ingen potter. For Henry er ikkje prest og ingen av oss er klokker. . Sjøl ikkje Gud kan hørra oss når me ber I frå Helvete. . Ivan la på sprang men kom aldri tilbake. Mange før han har prøvd å ta Henry av dage. Og ryktet fortelle at han som står med pisken. Er rake motsetningen av en viss kristen. . I Gruvene på 16 har me budd I fire år. Men så snart sjangsen byr seg slår eg meg ut,energetic.

The last thought that you think today . Has already happened . The link between profound and pain . Covers you like sherwin williams . . The smokey joe is broken . Drops into your lap . And the big red wasp . Makes a scan through . My black pages . . Last night our boy was out there . Burning up his matches . I saw him in the afternoon . Sporting a black eye . . The universal man . Holds a pistol or a bottle . Types with confidence . As we grow out of our . Bruises . . Once i had a friend . Who had the knack of tossing . His mind around geography . Boy you think<comma> you have problems . . The hunter is asleep . At least that's what i call him . In the afternoon . Of the new cobweb . Summer,sad.
The leading light of the age all wondered amongst. Themselves what I would do next. After all that I'd found in my travels around. The world was there anything else left?. "Gentlemen"<comma> I said<comma> "I've studied the maps". "And if what I'm thinking is right". "There's another new world at the top of the world". "For whoever can break through the ice". . I looked round the room in that way I once had. And I saw that they wanted belief. So I said "All I've got are my guts and my God". Then I paused<comma>"and the Annabelle Lee". Oh the Annabelle Lee<comma> I saw their eyes shine. The most beautiful ship in the sea. My Nina<comma> My Pinta<comma> My Santa Maria. My beautiful Annabelle Lee. . That spring we set sail as the crowd waved from shore. And on board the crew waved their hats. But I never had family just the Annabelle Lee. So I didn't have cause to look back. I just set the course north and I studied the charts. And toward dark I drifted toward sleep. And I dreamed of the fine deep harbor I'd find. Past the ice for my Annabelle Lee. . After that it got colder the world got quiet. It was never quite day or quite night. And the sea turned the color of sky turned the color. Of sea turned the color of ice. 'Til at last all around us was fastness. One vast glassy desert of arsenic white. And the waves that once lifted us. Sifted instead into drifts against Annabelle's sides. . The crew gathered closer at first for the comfort. But each morning would bring a new set. Of the tracks in the snow leading over the edge. Of the world 'til I was the only one left. After that it gets cloudy but it feels like I lay there. For days maybe for months. But Annabelle held me the two of us happy. Just to think back on all we had done. . We talked of the other worlds we'd discover. As she gave up her body to me. And as I chopped up her mainsail for timber. I told her of all that we still had to see. As the frost turned her moorings to nine-tail. And the wind lashed her sides in the cold. I burned her to keep me alive every night. In the lover's embrace of her hold. . I won't call it rescue what brought me here back to. The old world to drink and decline. And to pretend that the search for another new world. Was well-worth the burning of mine. But sometimes at night in my dreams comes the singing. Of some known tropical bird. And I smile in my sleep thinking Annabelle Lee. Has finally made it to another new world,sad.

If you could return to that certain-something spring. What decision would you amend then?. Could you dream of them?. . Stop and ask the night. What it stole from you.

The paranoid great movie queen. Sits idly fully armed. The powder and mascara there. A warning light for charm. We see her every movie night. The strong against the weak. The lines come out and struggle with. The empty voice that speaks. . Her heart is oh so tired now. Of kindnesses gone by. Like broken glasses in a drain. Gone down but not well spent. The road from Barbary to here. She sold then stole right back. The vanity<comma> insanity her hungry heart forgave. The fading bride's dull beauty grows. Just begging to be seen. Beneath the magic lights that reach from . Barbary to here. . Her schoolhouse mind has windows now. Where handsome creatures come to watch. The anaesthetic wearing off. Antarctica starts here,sad.

The rain it started tapping. On the window near my bed. There was a loophole in my dreaming. So I got out of it. And to my surprise my eyes were wide and already open. Just my nightstand and my dresser. Where those nightmares had just been. . So I dressed myself and left then . Out into the gray streets. But everything seemed different. And completely new to me. The sky the trees<comma> houses<comma> buildings<comma> even my own body. And each person I encountered . I couldn't wait to meet. . And I came upon a doctor. Who appeared in quite poor health. I said there's nothing that I can do for you  you can't do for yourself. He said oh yes you can<comma> just hold my hand<comma> I think that that would help. So I sat with him awhile. Then I asked him how he felt. . He said I think I'm cured. No<comma> in fact<comma> I'm sure of it. Thank you<comma> stranger . For your therapeutic smile. . So that's how I learned the lesson. That everyone's alone. And your eyes must do some raining. If you're ever gonna grow. And when crying don't help . You can't compose yourself. It's best to compose a poem. An honest verse of longing. Or a simple song of hope. . That's why I'm singing baby don't worry . 'Cause now I got your back. And every time you feel like crying. I'm gonna try and make you laugh. And if I can't . If it just hurts too bad. Then we'll wait for it to pass. And I will keep you company for those days so long and black. . And we'll keep working on the problem. We know we'll never solve. Of love's uneven remainders. Our lives are fractions of a whole. But if the world could remain within a frame. Like a painting on a wall. Then I think we'd see the beauty then. We'd stand staring in awe. . At our still lives posed . Like a bowl of oranges. Like a story told. By the fault-lines and the soil,happy.

There grows a weed looks like a flower. Looks like baby's breath on a mirror. . My girl and I rushed atop the altar. The sacrifice was made. It was not easy undertaking. The root's grip sucked like a living grave. . Oh young girl at the wedding. Baby's breath in her hair. A crowning lace above her face. That'll last a day before it turns to hay. . Good plans are made by hand. I'd cut a clearing in the land. For a little bed. For her to cry comfortable in. . And each day I looked out on the land. And I wondered what all was gone. Until I saw it was lucky old me. How could I run without losing anything?. How could I run without becoming lean?. It was agreed. It was a greed. It was me tearing out the baby's breath. . Oh I am a helpless man. So help me!. I'm on my knees. Gardening. Trying to make the baby's breath blow. . It was not a weed it was a flower. My baby's gone. Oh where has my baby gone?.

There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold. And she's buying a stairway to Heaven. When she gets there she knows. If the stores are all closed. With a word she can get what she came for. Ooo-oooh. And she's buying a stairway to Heaven. . There's a sign on the wall. But she wants to be sure. Cause you know sometimes words have. Two meanings. In a tree by the brook. There's a songbird who sings. Sometimes all of our thoughts are misleading. . Oooh makes me wonder. Oh-ooooh makes me wonder. . There's a feeling I get. When I look to the west. And my spirit is crying for leaving. In my thoughts I have seen. Rings of smoke through the trees. And the voices of those who stand looking. . And oooh makes me wonder. And oh-ooooh makes me wonder. . And it's whispered that soon. If we all call the tune. Then the piper will lead us to reason. And a new day will dawn. For those who stand long. And the forests will echo with laughter. . Yes it makes me wonder. And owowowow<comma> no. . If there's a bustle in your hedgerow. Don't be alarmed now. It's just a spring clean for the May-queen. Yes there are two paths you can go by. But in the long run. There's still time to change the road you're on. On and on. . Said ooooh makes me wonder. And oh-oh-oh-ooooh makes me wonder. . Your head is humming and it won't go. In case you don't know. The piper's calling you to join him. Dear lady can you hear the wind blow. And did you know. Your stairway lies on the whispering wind. Say!. Say!. . Mother<comma> Mary & Yozuf!. . And as we wind on down the road. Our shadows taller than our soul. There walks a lady we all know. Who shines white light and wants to know. How everything still turns to gold. And if you listen very hard. The news will come to you at last. When all are one and one is all. To be a rock and not to roll. . And she's buying a stairway to Heaven,sad.

There's a place out on the edge of town<comma> sir. Rising above the factories and the fields. Now<comma> ever since I was a child I can remember. That mansion on the hill. .

At night<comma> my daddy'd take me and we'd ride . Through the streets of a town so silent and still. Park on a back road along the highway side. Look up at that mansion on the hill. . In the summer<comma> all the lights would shine . There'd be music playing<comma> people laughing all the time. Me and my sister we'd hide out in the tall corn fields. Sit and listen to the mansion on the hill. . Tonight<comma> down here in Linden town . I watch the cars rushing by home from the mill. There's a beautiful full moon rising . Above the mansion on the hill,sad.

The ship went down to lay on the ground . At the bottom of the sea. I wound up on a deserted island. When the ancient lights held their dances in the sky. Well<comma> they nearly got me thinking that I could stay. But I had to get out right away. . But at last my shoes dropped back in the grooves. Of the city's slippery stairs. I stepped out on a deserted eyeland. When the mirrors on the moon shine down onto my lagoon . They make me think a lot about a rental car. Filled with half a tank of gas. Or what it would take to get me past . All the welcome signs they planted on the edge of town. Man<comma> I must surely be the luckiest guy around . Spending all this time above the ground. .

The sky is dark. The wind is cold. The night is young. Before it's old and grey. We will know. The trill of it all. The time has come. It's getting late. It's now or never. Don't hesitate or stall. When I call. Don't spoil. The thrill of it all. And before you go to sleep at night. Preying shadows - do they ask you why?. And in the morning through the afternoon. Do you wonder where you're going to?. Every word I use. Each crumpled page. Strange ideas. Mature with age. Like leaves. When autumn falls. Turn gold. Then they hit the ground. Every time I hear. The latest sound. It's pure whiskey. Reeling round and around. My brain. Oh and all o' that jive. It's driving me wild -. The dizzy spin I'm in. Everywhere I look. I see your face. I hear your name. It's all over the place. Hey girl. Though you've gone. Still I recall. The trill of it all. You might as well know what is right for you. And make the most of what you like to do. For all the pleasure that's surrounding you. Should compensate for all you're going through. So if you're feeling fraught. With mental strain. Too much thinking's got you down again. Well let your senses skip. Stay hip. Keep cool. To the thrill of it all. When you try too much. You lose control. Pressure rises. And so I'm told. Something's got the give. Oy Veh. High life ecstasy. You might as well live. I can't see. I can't speak. I couldn't take more than another week. Without you - oh no. So I will drink my fill. Till the trill is you. Oh the thrill of it all. Oh the thrill of it all. No I won't forget. The thrill of it all. No no no no no no no....,energetic.

This my excavation and today is Kumran. Everything that happens is from now on. This is pouring rain. This is paralyzed. . I keep throwing it down two-hundred at a time. It's hard to find it when you knew it. When your money's gone and you're drunk as hell. . On your back with your racks as the stacks as your load. In the back and the racks and the stacks of your load. In the back with your racks and you're un-stacking your load. . Well I've been twisting to the sun I needed to replace. The fountain in the front yard is rusted out. All my love was down in a frozen ground. . There's a black crow sitting across from me; his wiry legs are crossed. And he's dangling my keys he even fakes a toss. Whatever could it be that has brought me to this loss?. . On your back with your racks as the stacks as your load. In the back and the racks and the stacks of your load. In the back with your racks and you're un-stacking your load. . This is not the sound of a new man or crispy realization. It's the sound of the unlocking and the lift away. Your love will be. Safe with me,calm.

Filled with your old clothes. 1<comma>000 picture frames screaming out. He's not coming home<comma>". . Because time elapsed photography. Will hold your smiles unnaturally. Your face is framed with what you lost. And not the things that you want. . Sing out<comma> sing out<comma> sing out your joy. Raise up<comma> raise up<comma> raise up your voice,happy.

Pockets full of stones. . Lay me down. Let the only sound. Be the overflow. . 'Cause they took your loved ones. But returned them in exchange for you. But would you have it any other way?.

Wake stretch and move. Here comes another grey day. Wonder how late it is. Seems like there's no time for anything. What are you waiting for. Get your ass out the front door. Spend too much time. Trying to stay busy. Working and worrying. Planning to do something different. My friend mary says. Don't freak out about it. There's plenty of time. There's a coffin being built in the backyard. The sun came out today. Don't know how much time we've got left. But life seems empty so we fill it. With to-do lists. Drug and road trips. Singers singing about the same old shit. And when that's just not enough. Pry open the lid. I'm climbing in. But we keep on singing. Nail if fucking shut. I'm not getting in,angry.

No<comma> no<comma> no<comma> no<comma> no. . But until that time. I think I had better find. some disbelief to suspend. Cause I don't wanna feel like this again,lonely.

We sail through endless skies. Stars shine like eyes. The black night sighs. . The moon in silver dreams. Falls down in beams. Light of the night. . The Earth a purple blaze. Of sapphire haze.

As we travel the universe,sleepy.
We started living in an old house. My ma gave birth and we were checking it out. It was a baby boy. So we bought him a toy. It was a ray gun. And it was 1981. We named him "Baby". He had toothache. He started crying. It sounded like an earthquake. It didn't last long. Because I stopped it. I grabbed a rag doll. And stuck some little pins in it. . Now we're a family. And we're all right now. We got money. And a little place to fight now. We don't know you. And we don't owe you. But if you see us around. I got something else to show you. . Now it's easy. When you don't know better. You think it's sleazy. Then put it in a short letter. We keep warm. But there's just something wrong when you. Just feel like you're the hardest little button to button. . I had opinions. That didn't matter. I had a brain. That felt like pancake batter. I got a backyard. With nothing in it. Except a stick<comma> a dog. And a box with something in it. . The hardest button to button. The hardest button to button. The hardest button to button. The hardest button to button<comma> ah oh. The hardest button to button. The hardest button to button<comma> ah oh.

Yellow walls are lined with portraits. And I've got my new red fetching leather jacket. All these poses such beautiful poses. Makes any boy feel like picking up roses. . There's never been such grave a matter. As comparing our new brand name black sunglasses. All these poses such beautiful poses. Makes any boy feel as pretty as princes. . The green autumnal parks conductin'. And the city streets a wondrous chorus singing. All these poses oh how can you blame me. Life is a game and true love is a trophy. . And you said. Watch my head about it. Baby you said watch my head about it. My head about it. Oh no oh no oh no. Oh no oh no . No kidding. . Reclined amongst these packs of reasons. For to smoke the days away into the evenings. All these poses of classical torture. Ruined my mind like a snake in the orchard. . I did go from wanting to be someone. Now I'm drunk and wearing flip-flops on Fifth Avenue. Once you've fallen from classical virtue. Won't have a soul for to wake up and hold you. . In the green autumnal park conductin'. All the city streets a wondrous chorus singing. All these poses now no longer boyish. Made me a man ah but who cares what that is. . And you said watch my head about it. Baby you said watch my head about it. My head about it. Oh no oh no oh no. Oh no oh no. . And you said watch my head about it. Baby you said watch my head about it. My head about it. Oh no oh no oh no. Oh no oh no. No kidding,calm.

You never hear me talk about one day getting out. Why put a new address on the same old loneliness. Everybody knows where that is. We built that house of his. And when he's not home. Someone else you know always is. If Heaven's really coming back. I hope it has a heart attack. When they see how dangerous it is for guys like that. The night has always known when it's time to get going. When it's really been so long that it starts showing. It's always had that ghost who always almost. Tells me the Secret. How there's really no difference in who he was once. And who he's become. Everything you hated me for… Honey there was so much more. I just didn't get busted.. But I'm not looking for an easy way out. This whole life it's been about. Try and try and try. And try and try and try. To be simple again,nostalgic.
