I got a letter from the government. The other day. I opened and read it. It said they were suckers. They wanted me for their army or whatever. Picture me given' a damn - I said never. Here is a land that never gave a damn. About a brother like me and myself. Because they never did. I wasn't wit' it<comma> but just that very minute.... It occured to me. The suckers had authority. Cold sweatin' as I dwell in my cell. How long has it been?. They got me sittin' in the state pen. I gotta get out - but that thought was thought before. I contemplated a plan on the cell floor. I'm not a fugitive on the run. But a brother like me begun - to be another one. Public enemy servin' time - they drew the line y'all. To criticize me some crime - never the less. They could not understand that I'm a Black man. And I could never be a veteran. On the strength<comma> the situation's unreal. I got a raw deal<comma> so I'm goin' for the steel. . They got me rottin' in the time that I'm servin'. Tellin' you what happened the same time they're throwin'. 4 of us packed in a cell like slaves - oh well. The same motherfucker got us livin' is his hell. You have to realize - what its a form of slavery. Organized under a swarm of devils. Straight up - word'em up on the level. The reasons are several<comma> most of them federal. Here is my plan anyway and I say. I got gusto<comma> but only some I can trust - yo. Some do a bid from 1 to 10. And I never did<comma> and plus I never been. I'm on a tier where no tears should ever fall. Cell block and locked - I never clock it y'all. 'Cause time and time again time. They got me servin' to those and to them. I'm not a citizen. But ever when I catch a C-O. Sleepin' on the job - my plan is on go-ahead. On the strength<comma> I'ma tell you the deal. I got nothin' to lose. 'Cause I'm goin' for the steel. . You know I caught a C-O. Fallin' asleep on death row. I grabbed his gun - then he did what I said so. And everyman's got served. Along with the time they served. Decency was deserved. To understand my demands. I gave a warnin' - I wanted the governor<comma> y'all. And plus the warden to know. That I was innocent -. Because I'm militant. Posing a threat<comma> you bet it's fuckin' up the government. My plan said I had to get out and break north. Just like with Oliver's neck. I had to get off - my boys had the feds in check. They couldn't do nuthin'. We had a force to instigate a prison riot. This is what it takes for peace. So I just took the piece. Black for Black inside time to cut the leash. Freedom to get out - to the ghetto - no sell out. 6 C-Os we got we ought to put their head out. But I'll give 'em a chance<comma> cause I'm civilized. As for the rest of the world<comma> they can't realize. A cell is hell - I'm a rebel so I rebel. Between bars<comma> got me thinkin' like an animal. Got a woman C-O to call me a copter. She tried to get away<comma> and I popped her. Twice<comma> right. Now who wanna get nice?. I had 6 C-Os<comma> now it's 5 to go. And I'm serious - call me delirious. But I'm still a captive. I gotta rap this. Time to break as time grows intense. I got the steel in my right hand. Now I'm lookin' for the fence. . I ventured into the courtyard. Followed by 52 brothers. Bruised<comma> battered<comma> and scarred but hard. Goin' out with a bang. Ready to bang out. But power from the sky. And from the tower shots rang out. A high number of dose - yes. And some came close. Figure I trigger my steel. Stand and hold my post. This is what I mean - an anti-nigger machine. If I come out alive and then they won't - come clean. And then I threw up my steel bullets - flew up. Blew up<comma> who shot.... What<comma> who<comma> the bazooka was who. And to my rescue<comma> it was the S1Ws. Secured my getaway<comma> so I just gotaway. The joint broke<comma> from the black smoke. Then they saw it was rougher thatn the average bluffer. 'Cause the steel was black<comma> the attitude exact. Now the chase is on tellin' you to c'mon. 53 brothers on the run<comma> and we are gone,angry.

I live in a castle . I am a prince . On days I try . To please my queen . . Soon as I start to smile . My smiling queen . Who sits across the table . By the food she made . . Like a bat I flushed the girl . And I flew out my back door . And I came to no one no more . She ran without glances . And railed like a red coal train . . Eyelids are open . When the sun is high . I slip away from my queen's . Grey stare. . I can be settled down . and be doing just fine . Until I hear that old train . Rolling down the line . . With the light she disappeared . And set me in a whirl . And I hope that beautiful girl . . I set a fire burning . And I railed on through the night . I set a fire burning . And I railed on through the night . . She peeked around the corner . She offered me her hand . My teeth touched her skin . Then she was gone again . . Now my queen is fine . In her early grave . After that girl I'll keep her warm . There's nothing more to save,angry.
