Mána sta nóba bunita. Manxi ta sunha kordádu. Fla ma pobréza ka pa el. Ma trabádju kré sta-l mutu kansádu.. Ntom<comma> e fasi um bistidu nóbu. E sai di si kutélu. Bá Práia Sánta-Mariâ. Bá ránja um kasaméntu.. Mána bá sidádi grándi . Fla amem na sakraméntu. Se mai nem ka sabi d-el<comma>. Pai dja duenti só disgostu.. Mána ka kré kel k’é di sel. É só ta djobi pa ládu<comma>. Kel ki Nhordés da-l é poku pa el. E fla m-e sta mutu mal kalsádu.. Mána bá sidádi grándi . Tiru saí-l pa kulátra..,jazzy.

Oh... . Go to the mountain if you must. Go to the burning bush. Happy would ease your troubled mind. I'll be prepared to stay behind. . I know you better than you think I do. Don't worry<comma> dear<comma> this is why I fell in love with you. The man in the looking glass. Is looking back at you at last. . You can't hide from the truth<comma> because the truth is all there is. You can't hide from the truth<comma> because the truth is all there is. You can't hide from the truth<comma> because the truth is all there is. You can't hide.... . If happy times are too few and far between. It's a pity<comma> dear<comma> we can't erase the things we've seen. So disappear<comma> vanish if you wish. Just go before you're swallowed up by bitterness. . And the truth is<comma> you can't hide from the truth. And the truth hurts<comma> because the truth is all there is. I realized some time ago<comma> that I would have to let you go. . May not be true to say. That you'll return one day. But in your present state. You may as well not be here at all. You wear a thin disguise. It's from yourself you hide. Just take a look at us. We are heading for a fall. . Now presiding in this court of hip-hop justice. my rap forte is judge<comma> jury<comma> bailiff<comma> and prosecuting DA. Cause ceteris paribus<comma> my modus operandi. it's carpe diem whether de facto or de jure. Comprende? The people versus you and your sensei. Teaching that style of wordplay<comma> weaker than Wednesday. Regardless of what your friends say<comma> you're all dissable. Stricken from the record<comma> and deemed inadmissible. While this long arm of the law grabs the mic to. Shoot dope lines first and ask questions later. The def sentences of this Live litigator. To close a case tighter than the jaws of a gator. Stenographers are steady logging the jargon. That your counselors are barking in hopes of a plea bargain. But when you read back verbatim what they're saying to persuade them. You'll realize exactly how I played them. I come with the truth<comma> whole truth<comma> and nothing but. 'Cause the truth hurts just as much as fuckin' with Live will. I brew skill with refills from now until. Plagiarizing emcees get their flows distilled. . And baby<comma> I won't die without you by my side. As long as you return into these arms that burn. And baby<comma> I won't die<comma> just take a look inside. Into these eyes that burn<comma> come to these arms that yearn. I won't die if you leave me high. I won't die if you're not by my side. . And the truth hurts<comma> because the truth is all there is. . You can't hide from the truth. 'Cause the truth is all there is,jazzy.

Everybody's gone. I'm taking the receiver off the phone. Because baby you and me.... This night..... We're gonna get it on. To love serenade..... . You know I get in these moods.... Well you know how it is. And I'm very glad to know that you feel the same way too. Baby we're gonna lay here...And we're gonna make love. And we're gonna do it like its supposed to be done. Heaven only knows what goes on behind closed doors. The very depths of our souls will reach out tonight. You and me baby. In love...serenade. . Make me want you. Tempt me<comma> tempt me<comma> tempt me. Make me need you. Let me long for you. . You'll know what its like when a Man and Woman become One. And the only real way you can do that baby. Is when we're makin' love to each other. When you reach that. That simple feeling when you're makin love it's... It's like you're in another world. Help me.... Help me.... Oh baby help me.
