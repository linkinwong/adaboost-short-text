And I played the Red River Valley . And he'd sit in the kitchen and cry . Run his fingers through seventy years of livin' . And wonder<comma> "Lord<comma> has every well I've drilled gone dry?". We was friends<comma> me and this old man . Was like desperados waitin' for a train . Like desperados waitin' for a train . . Well<comma> he's a drifter and a driller of oil wells . And an old school man of the world . He taught me how to drive his car when he was too drunk to . And he'd wink and give me money for the girls . And our lives was like some old western movie . Like desperados waitin' for a train . Like desperados waitin' for a train . . From the time that I could walk<comma> he'd take me with him . To a bar called the Green Frog Cafe . And there was old men with beer guts and dominoes . Lying 'bout their lives while they played . And I was just a kid<comma> but they all called me "sidekick" . Was like desperados waitin' for a train . Like desperados waitin' for a train . . And one day I looked up and he's pushin' eighty . And has brown tobacco stains all down his chin . Well<comma> to me<comma> he's one of the heroes of this country . So why's he all dressed up like them old men . Drinkin' beer and playin' Moon and Forty-two . Just like a desperado waitin' for a train . Like a desperado waitin' for a train . . And then the day before he died I went to see him . I was grown and he was almost gone. So we just closed our eyes and dreamed us up a kitchen . And sang another verse to that old song . Come on<comma> Jack<comma> that son-of-a-bitch is comin' . We're desperados waitin' for a train . Was like desperados waitin' for a train. Like desperados waitin' for a train. Like desperados waitin' for a train,sad.

And now a road connects the cul-de-sac. To the adjacent development. But there used to be trees stretching back. And there was no way through. . And I was thankful for the mystery. But by the time that girl had hanged herself. I could have looked out my back window. And watched her neck just snap. . Baseball field lights that shine. Over the shedding pine. Each bulb's a blinding sphere. In the secular nation. Unhurried sirens moan. Pitches that glaze my eyes. She's just a pale fleshy typewriter-light advertisement for a wind chime that emits rays which resonate in the polluted sky. . All entrances to the. Merritt blocked off I mean. I'd love to believe that death's. Just the beginning as the. Shutters fly open and the. Breeze gives me pause. I know what's out there. morning phone calls silence and resentment and craters a new moon built in a line,energetic.
