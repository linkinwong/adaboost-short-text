By building up the means for war<comma> we thus preserve the peace. Such bullshit will prepare us for invasion from the east. And meanwhile<comma> they're carving up the land. The anglo-american military have taken full command. It's keeping us fed we're consuming it all. Fat on its culture and military control. Preparing for war bit by bit. Whilst we're watching its telly and eating its shit. They've got it all worked out and we give our consent. They've got it all worked out and we give our consent. They've got it all worked out and we give our consent. They've got it all worked out for Central America. They've got it all worked out for Ireland. By sitting back and keeping silent we give them our consent. Born in the shadow of the USA. Taught the fundamental bullshit every day. Force fed on a diet of Great British lies. Media distortions censor our minds. Passive spectators of royalty. Too diverted to care if we're free. ICI<comma> BP<comma> Thorn EMI. Red<comma> white<comma> and blue logos<comma> British pride. With a Big Mac in one hand and a Coke at our sides. We've accepted their culture and swallowed their lies. They've put up more fences<comma> watched us and spied. And cleverly told us they've got nothing to hide. For too long we've watched them preparing for battle. But the fightback is started little by little. Kicking at the midst of passive defense. Refusing cruise means tearing down fences. At Greenham and Molesworth<comma> fences you can see. But then there's all the barriers that are built around me. Political<comma> economic<comma> cultural<comma> social. And people who live in glass houses. Shouldn't encourage others to throw stones. Let the glossy shop fronts know what to expect. And colonel Sanders<comma> you're next

Always thought she'd stick around. always thought she'd stay. Now he's searching for the ring. the one she had to throw away. beach comber casts a shadow. long as his beard. never thought to cut it since his lover disappeared . she left him in this crazy state he's in . scouring the shoreline oh looking for the ring. oh the ring that was wrapped around her finger. she was just a dream and he was just a dreamer. there's a rhythm to his madness. a rhythm that he's in. retracing all the steps he walked. where once he was a king. his heart jolts awake to the beeps of. his machine starts racing faster faster. till it's a steady stream. he riffles through every grain of sand. one for everything that slipped through his hands. and his friends have all gone. gone with the tide. and he's standing on the shoreline. stranded in time. beach combing for his lost gold. something to have and to hold. oh small fortunes they sat and stay. too long to wash away. sweat dripping from his head. like a bridal shower. and dampening the gleaming sand. but mixed with tears so sour. coz he is just a dreamer . she was just a dream. he is just a dreamer. she was just a dream. he is just a dreamer she is just a dream . she is just a dream his is just a dreamer. she was just a dream . he is just a dreamer
A man made of butterfat. Careening around on a Sno-Cat. And I can't drive any faster. My hands are like ice and the moon shines. On pepper trees and road grease. The yellow lines look blue . . Snow covers Whitehall. White powdered Nembutal. And I can't think any more. My feet are like ice. And the moon sets. On Christmas trees and plastic deer . . I decided to forgive and forget. I thank god you're comatose. As I pull back the bedclothes. And I can't believe my composure. And I can't remember my anger. And summer is a fish story. I wonder where we'll be

While all the horses racin' taxis in the winter. Look up at the buildings imagine who might live there. Imagining your Wolford's in a ball upon the sink there. . You waited since lunch.
