A vestige of deeper purity etched in spirit agaisnt the sky. . The menhir had runes carved in limbs of oaken sovereignty. and could see the ages growing from within the palms. I can feel the era slipping into oblivion<comma>. no longer grasping the textures. I am slowly becoming stone. . As wolves celebrate the dusk<comma>. an old voice of wisdom haunts the vale. . Shapes flicker in the fire light through the windows. The woodlands burn with grace. Their silence drowns the age. . As wandering ghosts pass through the flames. A new age of rebirth lights the dawn. . But who are they who pass by the window?. The shapes; like black solar wheels scorched in the snow. by gods of the stone.... This elder stone shall never fall!. . Cast the aeons into the void. So that no other can seek them. No age<comma> no hands shall taint them. Pour the sorrows into the sun. They are lost forever in dark woods of time. Carve the symbols into the stone. So that another can find them. No age<comma> no hands shall change them. Pour the ages into the sun. They are lost forever in the dark woods of time

I got a letter from the government. The other day. I opened and read it. It said they were suckers. They wanted me for their army or whatever. Picture me given' a damn - I said never. Here is a land that never gave a damn. About a brother like me and myself. Because they never did. I wasn't wit' it<comma> but just that very minute.... It occured to me. The suckers had authority. Cold sweatin' as I dwell in my cell. How long has it been?. They got me sittin' in the state pen. I gotta get out - but that thought was thought before. I contemplated a plan on the cell floor. I'm not a fugitive on the run. But a brother like me begun - to be another one. Public enemy servin' time - they drew the line y'all. To criticize me some crime - never the less. They could not understand that I'm a Black man. And I could never be a veteran. On the strength<comma> the situation's unreal. I got a raw deal<comma> so I'm goin' for the steel. . They got me rottin' in the time that I'm servin'. Tellin' you what happened the same time they're throwin'. 4 of us packed in a cell like slaves - oh well. The same motherfucker got us livin' is his hell. You have to realize - what its a form of slavery. Organized under a swarm of devils. Straight up - word'em up on the level. The reasons are several<comma> most of them federal. Here is my plan anyway and I say. I got gusto<comma> but only some I can trust - yo. Some do a bid from 1 to 10. And I never did<comma> and plus I never been. I'm on a tier where no tears should ever fall. Cell block and locked - I never clock it y'all. 'Cause time and time again time. They got me servin' to those and to them. I'm not a citizen. But ever when I catch a C-O. Sleepin' on the job - my plan is on go-ahead. On the strength<comma> I'ma tell you the deal. I got nothin' to lose. 'Cause I'm goin' for the steel. . You know I caught a C-O. Fallin' asleep on death row. I grabbed his gun - then he did what I said so. And everyman's got served. Along with the time they served. Decency was deserved. To understand my demands. I gave a warnin' - I wanted the governor<comma> y'all. And plus the warden to know. That I was innocent -. Because I'm militant. Posing a threat<comma> you bet it's fuckin' up the government. My plan said I had to get out and break north. Just like with Oliver's neck. I had to get off - my boys had the feds in check. They couldn't do nuthin'. We had a force to instigate a prison riot. This is what it takes for peace. So I just took the piece. Black for Black inside time to cut the leash. Freedom to get out - to the ghetto - no sell out. 6 C-Os we got we ought to put their head out. But I'll give 'em a chance<comma> cause I'm civilized. As for the rest of the world<comma> they can't realize. A cell is hell - I'm a rebel so I rebel. Between bars<comma> got me thinkin' like an animal. Got a woman C-O to call me a copter. She tried to get away<comma> and I popped her. Twice<comma> right. Now who wanna get nice?. I had 6 C-Os<comma> now it's 5 to go. And I'm serious - call me delirious. But I'm still a captive. I gotta rap this. Time to break as time grows intense. I got the steel in my right hand. Now I'm lookin' for the fence. . I ventured into the courtyard. Followed by 52 brothers. Bruised<comma> battered<comma> and scarred but hard. Goin' out with a bang. Ready to bang out. But power from the sky. And from the tower shots rang out. A high number of dose - yes. And some came close. Figure I trigger my steel. Stand and hold my post. This is what I mean - an anti-nigger machine. If I come out alive and then they won't - come clean. And then I threw up my steel bullets - flew up. Blew up<comma> who shot.... What<comma> who<comma> the bazooka was who. And to my rescue<comma> it was the S1Ws. Secured my getaway<comma> so I just gotaway. The joint broke<comma> from the black smoke. Then they saw it was rougher thatn the average bluffer. 'Cause the steel was black<comma> the attitude exact. Now the chase is on tellin' you to c'mon. 53 brothers on the run<comma> and we are gone

Wake stretch and move. Here comes another grey day. Wonder how late it is. Seems like there's no time for anything. What are you waiting for. Get your ass out the front door. Spend too much time. Trying to stay busy. Working and worrying. Planning to do something different. My friend mary says. Don't freak out about it. There's plenty of time. There's a coffin being built in the backyard. The sun came out today. Don't know how much time we've got left. But life seems empty so we fill it. With to-do lists. Drug and road trips. Singers singing about the same old shit. And when that's just not enough. Pry open the lid. I'm climbing in. But we keep on singing. Nail if fucking shut. I'm not getting in

All the other girls here are stars - you are the northern lights. They try to shine in through your curtains - you're too close and too bright. They try and they try but everything that they do. Is the ghost of a trace of a pale imitation of you. I'll be the one to drive you back home Kathleen. . This party was made with the night air and the chance that a smile. Will wind its way from your face to one of the boys in your line. You act like you're hip to their tricks and you're strong. But a virgin Wurlitzer heart never once had a song. I'll be the one to drive you back home Kathleen. . And I'll have you back by break of day. I'm going your way anyway. And if you'd like to come along. I'll be yours for a song. . I know you are waiting and I know that it is not for me. But I'm here and I'm ready and I've saved you the passenger seat. I won't be your last dance just your last goodnight. Every heart is a package tangled up in knots someone else tied. I'll be the one to drive you back home Kathleen. . So crawl up your trellis and quietly back into your room. And I'll coast down the length of your drive by the light of the moon. And the next time I see you - a new kind of hello. Both our hearts have a secret only both of us know. 'Bout the night that I drove you back home Kathleen
All there years you've been speaking without breathing. Spinning closer to the sun. Had your way with an unsuspecting public. Little threads are all it takes. La la la la .... I have learned all your secrets<comma> so familiar. I know where you lay your head. Fear of god and a disappointing father. Holds the hand around your neck. La la la la .... Sometimes I could just choke myself with laughter. Sometimes everything's so true. So when you come down from your death-defying labors. I'll still be in love with you. La la la la ...

Always thought she'd stick around. always thought she'd stay. Now he's searching for the ring. the one she had to throw away. beach comber casts a shadow. long as his beard. never thought to cut it since his lover disappeared . she left him in this crazy state he's in . scouring the shoreline oh looking for the ring. oh the ring that was wrapped around her finger. she was just a dream and he was just a dreamer. there's a rhythm to his madness. a rhythm that he's in. retracing all the steps he walked. where once he was a king. his heart jolts awake to the beeps of. his machine starts racing faster faster. till it's a steady stream. he riffles through every grain of sand. one for everything that slipped through his hands. and his friends have all gone. gone with the tide. and he's standing on the shoreline. stranded in time. beach combing for his lost gold. something to have and to hold. oh small fortunes they sat and stay. too long to wash away. sweat dripping from his head. like a bridal shower. and dampening the gleaming sand. but mixed with tears so sour. coz he is just a dreamer . she was just a dream. he is just a dreamer. she was just a dream. he is just a dreamer she is just a dream . she is just a dream his is just a dreamer. she was just a dream . he is just a dreamer

A man made of butterfat. Careening around on a Sno-Cat. And I can't drive any faster. My hands are like ice and the moon shines. On pepper trees and road grease. The yellow lines look blue . . Snow covers Whitehall. White powdered Nembutal. And I can't think any more. My feet are like ice. And the moon sets. On Christmas trees and plastic deer . . I decided to forgive and forget. I thank god you're comatose. As I pull back the bedclothes. And I can't believe my composure. And I can't remember my anger. And summer is a fish story. I wonder where we'll be

Andalucia when can I see you. When it is snowing out again. Farmer John wants you. Louder and softer closer and nearer. Then again. Needing you taking you keeping you leaving you. In a year and a day to be sure. That your face doesn't alter. Your words never falter -- I love you. . I'll be here waiting later and later. Hoping the night will go away. Andalucia Castles and Christians. Andalucia come to stay. You were lost<comma> once before<comma> on a day much like this. When you'd made up your mind not to come. And I couldn't persuade you. Or wait till tomorrow -- or pass the time

And now a road connects the cul-de-sac. To the adjacent development. But there used to be trees stretching back. And there was no way through. . And I was thankful for the mystery. But by the time that girl had hanged herself. I could have looked out my back window. And watched her neck just snap. . Baseball field lights that shine. Over the shedding pine. Each bulb's a blinding sphere. In the secular nation. Unhurried sirens moan. Pitches that glaze my eyes. She's just a pale fleshy typewriter-light advertisement for a wind chime that emits rays which resonate in the polluted sky. . All entrances to the. Merritt blocked off I mean. I'd love to believe that death's. Just the beginning as the. Shutters fly open and the. Breeze gives me pause. I know what's out there. morning phone calls silence and resentment and craters a new moon built in a line
