Throw a stone and watch the ripples flow. Moving out across the bay. Like a stone I fall into your eyes. Deep into that mystery. Deep into some mystery. . I got half a mind to scream out loud. I got half a mind to die. So I won't ever have to lose you girl. Won't ever have to say goodbye. I won't ever have to lie. Won't ever have to say goodbye. . Whoa whoa whoa I. Whoa whoa whoa I.

Que tendrán todo el calor de un beso. De esos besos que te dí. Y que jamás te encontrarán. En el calor de otro querer. . A tu lado vivirán y se hablarán. Como cuando estás conmigo. Y hasta creerán que se diran:. Te quiero.. Pero si un atardecer. Las gardenias de mi amor se mueren. Es porque han adivinado. Que tu amor me ha traicionado.

And no place to send them. . Live like Emily Dickinson. Without so much as a kiss. Or the comfort of strangers. Withdrawing into herself. . But why this.

It's bad timing and me. We find a lot of things out this way. And there's you. A little black cloud in a dress. The temptation. To take the precious things we have apart. To see how they work. Must be resisted for they never fit together again. . If this is rain let it fall on me and drown me. If these are tears let them fall. . Must I paint you a picture. About the way that I feel?. You know my love for you is strong<comma> girl. You know my love for you is real. . It took a short walk and a talk . To change the rules of engagement. While you searched frantically for reverse. And them claiming . That virtue never tested is no virtue at all . And so I lost my ignorance. And now the bells across the river chime out your name. I look across to them again. . Must I paint you a picture. About the way that I feel?. You know my love for you is strong<comma> girl. You know my love for you is real. . All your friends said come down. It will never fly. And on that imperfect day. We threw it all away. Crisis after crisis. With such intensity. This would never happen if we lived by the sea. . Most important decisions in life. Are made between two people in bed. I found that out at my expense. And when I see you. You just turn around and walk away like we never met. Oh we used to be so brave. .

Like the beat beat beat of the tom-toms. When the jungle shadows fall. Like the tick tick tock of the stately clock. As it stands against the wall. Like the drip drip drip of the raindrops. When the summer shower is through. So a voice within me keeps repeating you<comma> you<comma> you. . Night and day<comma> you are the one. Only you beneath the moon or under the sun. Whether near to me<comma> or far. It's no matter darling where you are. I think of you. Night and day<comma> day and night why is it so. That this longing for you follows wherever I go. In the roaring traffic's boom. In the silence of my lonely room. I think of you. Night and day<comma> day and night. Under the hide of me. There's an oh such a hungry yearning burning inside of me. And this torment won't be through. Until you let me spend my life making love to you.

I'll be the one to drive you back home Kathleen. . And I'll have you back by break of day. I'm going your way anyway. And if you'd like to come along. I'll be yours for a song. . I know you are waiting and I know that it is not for me. But I'm here and I'm ready and I've saved you the passenger seat. I won't be your last dance just your last goodnight.

You tried to taste me. I taped my tongue to the southern tip of your body. Our bones are too heavy to come up. Squished into a single cell of wood. . And I made an excuse. And you found another way to tell the truth. I put no one else us above us. We'll still be best friends when all turns to dust. . We are so smooth now. Our edges are beaten driftwood whittled down. Old bodies slip when they make love. We'll mine our sparks to shoot above us,0.105311,0.365899,1.483424,2.142893,0.4685,0.241776,0.028233,0.000319,0.424928,0.210376,0.15759,0.07177,0.347026,0.650062,0.291745,0.09481,0.088582,0.099619,0.097818,0.060374,0.122303,47.677864,37.771534,111.3198,6.888316,1.56648,0.514034,1.433559,0.887881,0.101589,50.40662,5.48372,503.6048,1.90735,0.014432,0.007429,0.650581,0.000452,0.00953,1799.12,0.390098,0,0.921438,0.131561,0,0.072438,0.004064,1145.916,143074.9,0.018517,0.637661,-9.055779,0.436155,-6.728711,1.128678,0.003533,0.481188,3.220846,2706,0.040101,-0.000006,0.138499,-0.008304,-0.005918,0.890677,0.000062,0.000004,-0.399042,romantic

Oh the sisters of mercy. They are not departed or gone. They were waiting for me. When I thought that I just can't go on. And they brought me their comfort . And later they brought me this song. Oh I hope you run into them . You who've been traveling so long. . Yes you who must leave everything . That you cannot control. It begins with your family . But soon it comes round to your soul. Well<comma> I've been where you're hanging. I think I can see how you're pinned. When you're not feeling holy. Your loneliness says that you've sinned. . They lay down beside me. I made my confession to them. They touched both my eyes. And I touched the dew on their hem. If your life is a leaf. That the seasons tear off and condemn. They will bind you with love. That is graceful and green as a stem. . When I left they were sleeping. I hope you run into them soon. Don't turn on the lights. You can read their address by the moon. And you won't make me jealous. If I hear that they sweetened your night. We weren't lovers like that. And besides it would still be all right. . We weren't lovers like that.

A hundred days have made me older . Since the last time that I saw your pretty face . A thousand lies have made me colder. And I don't think I can look at this the same . But all the miles that separate . They disappear now when I'm dreaming of your face . . I'm here without you baby . But you're still on my lonely mind . I think about you baby . And I dream about you all the time . I'm here without you baby . And you're still with me in my dreams . And tonight it's only you and me yeah. . The miles just keep rollin'. As the people leave their way to say hello . I've heard this life is overrated . But I hope that it gets better as we go oh yeah. . I'm here without you baby . But you're still on my lonely mind . I think about you baby . And I dream about you all the time . I'm here without you baby . But you're still with me in my dreams . And tonight girl it's only you and me . . Everything I know . And anywhere I go . It gets hard but it won't take away my love  . And when the last one falls . When it's all said and done . It gets hard but it won't take away my love whoa oh oh. .

They were born. And then they lived. And then they died. Seems so unfair. I want to cry. You say: "Ere thrice the sun hath done. salutation to the dawn". And you claim these words as your own. But I've read well and I've heard them said. A hundred times (maybe less<comma> maybe more). If you must write prose or poems. The words you use should be your own. Don't plagiarise or take 'on loan'. There's always someone<comma> somewhere. With a big nose who knows. And who trips you up and laughs. When you fall. Who'll trip you up and laugh. When you fall. You say: "Ere long done do does did". Words which could only be your own. And then produce the text. From whence was ripped. 'Some dizzy whore'<comma> 1804. A dreaded sunny day. So let's go where we're happy. And I meet you at the cemetry gates. Oh Keats and Yeats are on your side. A dreaded sunny day. So let's go where we're wanted. And I meet you at the cemetry gates.

And our frail eyes and there watch to finally talk. . One brash phrase cut crush these fragile days. My thoughts swirl in some shrill sad cannonade. And one such spur that caused my throat to creak. The one dull dawn that I've since sensed to repeat,0.03525,1.299031,1.548191,2.428223,0.307714,0.091354,0.031315,0.000157,0.437734,0.215006,0.192686,0.082644,0.859896,0.512766,0.349249,0.155457,0.099197,0.125176,0.12975,0.096346,0.499294,17.059783,10.867816,59.76837,3.963875,1.225945,1.184985,0.84086,0.868896,0.076617,83.60551,6.68761,460.5599,2.576688,0.083664,0.384701,0.209695,0.000598,0.005139,4762.331,2.545901,0,0.992676,0.152313,0,0.007275,0.00115,397.1667,383517.4,0.019232,4.466534,0.21058,-1.282677,-7.392418,4.115737,0.003786,0.911784,6.542534,1014,0.095894,0.000007,-0.032983,-0.453766,0.001337,1.130666,-0.000018,-0.000061,-0.250155,notromantic

A man made of butterfat. Careening around on a Sno-Cat. And I can't drive any faster. My hands are like ice and the moon shines. On pepper trees and road grease. The yellow lines look blue . . Snow covers Whitehall. White powdered Nembutal. And I can't think any more. My feet are like ice. And the moon sets. On Christmas trees and plastic deer . . I decided to forgive and forget. I thank god you're comatose. As I pull back the bedclothes. And I can't believe my composure. And I can't remember my anger. And summer is a fish story.

Anda my love. Wake up to your window . The day calls in billows . It's echoing moonlight onto the blue nightmare of your heart. In cosy red rainbow . It's shaking off halos . And the memory of our sacred so and so's. . Oh<comma> take my hand sweet . Complete your release. Unbury your feet . And married we'll be. Alone in receiving ours is a feeling. Not that they would see. They don't know that we could be . Down where your cradle escaped the sea . And your raven-haired mama caught told you so's. . We're laying in the shadow of your family tree . Your haunted heart and me. Brought down by an old idea whose time has come . And in the shadow of the gallows of your family tree . There's a hundred hearts or three. Pumping blood to the roots of evil to keep them young . . Ah me all mine. Is it safe to say that we've waited patiently . Call me on time . And recall the tune that has placed us gracefully . All into line . There's a garden grave and a place there saved for you . I fall by your side . Though your silver-haired mama throws told-you so's . . We're laying in the shadow of your family tree. Your haunted heart and me. Brought down by an old idea whose time has come.

And now a road connects the cul-de-sac. To the adjacent development. But there used to be trees stretching back. And there was no way through. . And I was thankful for the mystery. But by the time that girl had hanged herself. I could have looked out my back window. And watched her neck just snap. . Baseball field lights that shine. Over the shedding pine. Each bulb's a blinding sphere. In the secular nation. Unhurried sirens moan. Pitches that glaze my eyes. She's just a pale fleshy typewriter-light advertisement for a wind chime that emits rays which resonate in the polluted sky. . All entrances to the. Merritt blocked off I mean. I'd love to believe that death's. Just the beginning as the. Shutters fly open and the. Breeze gives me pause.

Another bloated disco<comma> . Another sniff of romance I'll forget. We promised to ourselves before we came out . We'd do something we regret. . These people are your friends. This cunted circus never ends. I won't remember anything you say. . I lost my social skills a while ago . But now I feel them coming back. My eyes were rolling when we met . And now they are preparing for attack. . I want to fall in love tonight . And form the perfect unbreakable bond. You can be my teenage Jenny Agutter . Swimming naked in a pond. . You know i'm always moanin'. But you jumpstart my seratonin. But how d'you know you've ever really loved?. . But when I feel like this<comma> I know it doesn't matter. When I eat when I'm not hungy I'm sure I feel my face get fatter. Then I thin out every weekend and I think that she might want me. But I always slip off my own 'cause.... . I let those feelings haunt me<comma> they control me<comma> . But tonight I'm letting go. You're more then just a photo album<comma> . You're more than what some people let you know. . And if we ever make it home<comma> . I'll tell you all the things that shaped me thus;. Something forged in a phonebox but lost in a restaurant . We've got so much to discuss. . Here<comma> have you tried the blue ones?. I hear he's got some new ones. Sleep is not an option tonight. . Look at us just stand and stare. Look at them just pose and pout.
