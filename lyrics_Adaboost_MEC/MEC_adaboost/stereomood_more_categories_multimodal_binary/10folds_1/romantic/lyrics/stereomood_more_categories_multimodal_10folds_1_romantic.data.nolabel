Please forgive me. If I act a little strange. For I know not what I do.. Feels like lightning running through my veins. Everytime I look at you. Everytime I look at you. . Help me out here. All my words are falling short. And there's so much I want to say. Want to tell you just how good it feels. When you look at me that way. When you look at me that way. . Throw a stone and watch the ripples flow. Moving out across the bay. Like a stone I fall into your eyes. Deep into that mystery. Deep into some mystery. . I got half a mind to scream out loud. I got half a mind to die. So I won't ever have to lose you girl. Won't ever have to say goodbye. I won't ever have to lie. Won't ever have to say goodbye. . Whoa whoa whoa I. Whoa whoa whoa I. Whoa whoa whoa I. . Please forgive me. If I act a little strange. For I know not what I do. Feels like lightning running through my veins. Everytime I look at you. Everytime I look at you. Everytime I look at you. Everytime I look at you

Dos gardenias para ti. Con ellas quiero decir:. Te quiero<comma> te adoro<comma> mi vida. Ponles toda tu atención. Que seran tu corazón y el mio. . Dos gardenias para ti. Que tendrán todo el calor de un beso. De esos besos que te dí. Y que jamás te encontrarán. En el calor de otro querer. . A tu lado vivirán y se hablarán. Como cuando estás conmigo. Y hasta creerán que se diran:. Te quiero.. Pero si un atardecer. Las gardenias de mi amor se mueren. Es porque han adivinado. Que tu amor me ha traicionado. Porque existe otro querer. x 2

She was no longer a user. Don't think she realised we knew that. Not one to make a fuss. Why this and not something else. Wasn't it obvious?. . She made such a hash of it. You can't help but notice. And an absence of tenderness. And who wants to live like that. . And friends turn their backs on her. She - no longer a user. And she wanted to stay home. With a box full of postcards . And no place to send them. . Live like Emily Dickinson. Without so much as a kiss. Or the comfort of strangers. Withdrawing into herself. . But why this. And not something else

Sun been down for days. A pretty flower in a vase. A slipper by the fireplace. A cello lying in its case. . Soon she's down the stairs. Her morning elegance she wears.

And she fights for her life on the train. She looks at the rain as it pours. And she fights for her life. As she goes in a store. With a thought she has caught by a thread. She pays for the bread. And she goes.... . Nobody knows. . Sun been down for days. A winter melody she plays. The thunder makes her contemplate. She hears a noise behind the gate. Perhaps a letter with a dove.
