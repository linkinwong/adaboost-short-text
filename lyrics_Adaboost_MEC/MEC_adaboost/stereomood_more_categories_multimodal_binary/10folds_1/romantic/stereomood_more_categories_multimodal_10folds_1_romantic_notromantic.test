An ancient business<comma> a modern piece of glass work. Down on the corner that you walk each day in passing. The elderly sales clerk won't eye us with suspicion.

Out in both directions a thousand little Julia's. That come together in the middle of Manhattan. . You waited since lunch. It all comes at once. . Around the corner<comma> the house that modern art built. I ask for modern art to keep it out the closets. The people who might own it<comma> the sins of pride and envy. And on the second floor the Richard Serra Skate Park. . You waited since lunch. It all comes at once. . Sit on the park wall<comma> ask all the right questions.

A dreaded sunny day. So I meet you at the cemetry gates. Keats and Yeats are on your side. A dreaded sunny day. So I meet you at the cemetry gates. Keats and Yeats are on your side. While Wilde is on mine. So we go inside and we gravely read the stones. All those people<comma> all those lives. Where are they now?. With loves and hates. And passions just like mine. They were born. And then they lived. And then they died. Seems so unfair. I want to cry. You say: "Ere thrice the sun hath done. salutation to the dawn". And you claim these words as your own. But I've read well and I've heard them said. A hundred times (maybe less<comma> maybe more). If you must write prose or poems. The words you use should be your own. Don't plagiarise or take 'on loan'. There's always someone<comma> somewhere. With a big nose who knows. And who trips you up and laughs. When you fall. Who'll trip you up and laugh. When you fall. You say: "Ere long done do does did". Words which could only be your own. And then produce the text. From whence was ripped. 'Some dizzy whore'<comma> 1804. A dreaded sunny day. So let's go where we're happy. And I meet you at the cemetry gates. Oh Keats and Yeats are on your side. A dreaded sunny day. So let's go where we're wanted. And I meet you at the cemetry gates.
