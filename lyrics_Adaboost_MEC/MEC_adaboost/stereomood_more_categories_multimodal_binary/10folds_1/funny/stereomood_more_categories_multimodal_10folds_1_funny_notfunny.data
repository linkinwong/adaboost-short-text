[Slug]. If I was a rich man. I'd buy you some shoes. Tall boots for all the dirt you walk through. What would that do?. Enable you to deal. Without schooling you on how to touch what's real. And if I was a smart man. I'd tell you everything that I knew. And give it to you every time you need a talking to. But what would that do?. Teach you my guidelines. So you can be a cheerleader at your game on the sidelines. And if I was a driver. I'd keep my headlights on. To see the difference between right and wrong. I'd wear my seatbelt even when I'm in park. Cause I don't trust the other fools that cruise through these parts. And if I was a better cook. I'd hook up a feast. Set a table full of food for the children to eat. I encourage the nourishment so we can breathe. With the knowledge that we got something accomplished. . Chorus:. And if I was Santa Claus<comma> I'd fight for the cause. Wouldn't expect nothing in return. I'd give you everything you want<comma> I'd be everything you need. So you can take my hand and I can take the lead. . And if I was an honest man. I would stop writing songs. I'd break for a nervous breakdown for breakfast. Tell everyone I knew to stay away from making music. It ain't nothing but a confusing mess (confusing mess). And if I was you<comma> I wouldn't hear a word I said. Wouldn't trust nothing to start it up inside my head. I'd make a conscious effort to live instead. Of trying to kill the monsters that reside underneath the bed. And if I was a hurt man. I'd find a way to put my faith . Into a woman that could take me from today. Maybe. I need somebody that could save me. From the parts of myself that keep making me crazy. And if I was a wise man. I'd climb to the top of the mountain peak. To think about strength versus weakness. I'd find a point that rests a couple of feet above your head. And figure out how I could try to help you reach it. (Ho ho ho). And if I did have a choice. I'd never want to live forever. Just let me have a voice so I can make my points. I can't imagine running a race with no finish line. Just let me keep my pace and make to most of my time. I love giving but I'm bad at receiving. The truth is<comma> I'd prefer to be the one bleeding. But I'm a paranoid that stays between play and work. Cautious and aware<comma> 'cause I'm afraid of being hurt. Which brings me to the issue. And that would be this:. How often must I ask myself why I exist?. I feel like a freak<comma> this world is a circus. Just trying to find myself as well as my purpose. . Chorus:. And if I was Santa Claus<comma> I'd fight for the cause. Wouldn't expect nothing in return. I'd give you everything you want<comma> I'd be everything you need. And you can take my hand and I can take the lead (2x). . I got nothing but gifts. Keep it up in my wits. Got me drunk on the fifth. And now we're stuck in a ditch. And as dumb as it gets. I'mma run you some fibs (?). I wanna touch your lips. I wanna rub your hips. Put a glove on the fist. For the love that exists. We'll keep bumping the hits. To get my bucket of chips. From the Bloods and the Crips. To the skateboarding chicks. Put the Atmosphere on your Christmas wishlist (2x).

Not to put too fine a point on it. Say I'm the only bee in your bonnet. Make a little birdhouse in your soul. . I'm your only friend. I'm not your only friend. But I'm a little glowing friend. But really I'm not actually your friend. But I am. . There's a picture opposite me. Of my primitive ancestry. Which stood on rocky shores. And kept the beaches shipwreck free. Though I respect that a lot. I'd be fired if that were my job. After killing Jason off and. Countless screaming Argonauts. Bluebird of friendliness. Like guardian angels it's always near. .

I woke up this morning . With a bad hangover . And my penis was missing again. . This happens all the time. It's detachable. . This comes in handy a lot of the time. I can leave it home . When I think it's going to get me in trouble. Or I can rent it out. When I don't need it. . But now and then I go to a party. Get drunk. And the next morning I can't for the life of me. Remember what I did with it.. . First I looked around my apartment . And I couldn't find it . So I called up the place where the party was. They hadn't seen it either. . I asked them to check the medicine cabinet. Because for some reason I leave it there sometimes . But not this time. So I told them if it pops up to let me know. . I called some other people from the party . But they were no help either. . I was starting to get desperate. I really don't like being without my penis for too long. It makes me feel like less of a man. And I really hate having to sit down every time I take a leak. . After a few hours of searching the house. And calling everyone I could think of. I was starting to get very depressed. So I went to the Kiev and ate breakfast. . Then as I walked down Second Avenue . Towards St. Mark's place. Where all those people sell used books. And other junk on the street. I saw my penis lying on a blanket . Next to a broken toaster oven. Some guy was selling it. . I had to buy it off him . He wanted 22 bucks. But I talked him down to 17. . I took it home<comma> washed it off. And put it back on. I was happy again. Complete. . People sometimes tell me I should get it permanently attached. But<comma> I don't know. Even though it's sometimes a pain in the ass.

They were born. And then they lived. And then they died. Seems so unfair. I want to cry. You say: "Ere thrice the sun hath done. salutation to the dawn". And you claim these words as your own. But I've read well and I've heard them said. A hundred times (maybe less<comma> maybe more). If you must write prose or poems. The words you use should be your own. Don't plagiarise or take 'on loan'. There's always someone<comma> somewhere. With a big nose who knows. And who trips you up and laughs. When you fall. Who'll trip you up and laugh. When you fall. You say: "Ere long done do does did". Words which could only be your own. And then produce the text. From whence was ripped. 'Some dizzy whore'<comma> 1804. A dreaded sunny day. So let's go where we're happy. And I meet you at the cemetry gates. Oh Keats and Yeats are on your side. A dreaded sunny day. So let's go where we're wanted. And I meet you at the cemetry gates.

All the other girls here are stars - you are the northern lights. They try to shine in through your curtains - you're too close and too bright. They try and they try but everything that they do. Is the ghost of a trace of a pale imitation of you. I'll be the one to drive you back home Kathleen. . This party was made with the night air and the chance that a smile. Will wind its way from your face to one of the boys in your line. You act like you're hip to their tricks and you're strong. But a virgin Wurlitzer heart never once had a song. I'll be the one to drive you back home Kathleen. . And I'll have you back by break of day. I'm going your way anyway. And if you'd like to come along. I'll be yours for a song. . I know you are waiting and I know that it is not for me. But I'm here and I'm ready and I've saved you the passenger seat. I won't be your last dance just your last goodnight. Every heart is a package tangled up in knots someone else tied. I'll be the one to drive you back home Kathleen. . So crawl up your trellis and quietly back into your room. And I'll coast down the length of your drive by the light of the moon. And the next time I see you - a new kind of hello. Both our hearts have a secret only both of us know.

And recall the tune that has placed us gracefully . All into line . There's a garden grave and a place there saved for you . I fall by your side . Though your silver-haired mama throws told-you so's . . We're laying in the shadow of your family tree. Your haunted heart and me. Brought down by an old idea whose time has come. And in the shadow of the gallows of your family tree. There's a hundred hearts or three. Pumping blood to the roots of evil to keep them young. . Now we're gathered in the shadow of your family tree. In halted harmony. Brought down by an old idea whose time has come . And in the shadow of the valley of your family tree. There's a hundred hearts or three.
