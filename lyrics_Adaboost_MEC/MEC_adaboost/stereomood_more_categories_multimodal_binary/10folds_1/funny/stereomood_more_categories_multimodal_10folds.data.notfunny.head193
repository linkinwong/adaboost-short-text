Sometimes I could just choke myself with laughter. Sometimes everything's so true. So when you come down from your death-defying labors. I'll still be in love with you. La la la la ...,calm.

Are you waiting for me?. At the end of the airport. I'm off buying our tickets. Auteur in hibernation. But I'm feeling impatient. We were late for departure. . And the smell of pajamas. Is what makes me feel frivol. There are minutes for sleeping. But we didn't have minutes to spare. . So you're feeling sleepy. Sympathize with the retard. Being held by his mother. She's got spit in her napkin. And she's pushing him that way. Like a stench to the men's room. . And it's making you nauseous. Where the hell have I got to?. There's a boy who's a Krishna. And he thinks you look pretty. Well holiday fun),angry.

As I was walkin' down rubadub square. Not a chill to the wind,happy.
A small Jean Genie snuck off to the city. Strung out on lasers and slash back blazers and. Ate all your razors while pulling the waiters. Talking 'bout Monroe and walking on Snow White. New York's a go-go and everything tastes nice. Poor little Greenie go,groovy.

As someone sets light to the first fire of autumn. We settle down to cut ourselves apart. Cough and twitch from the news on your face. And some foreign candle burning in your eyes. . Held to the past we've no recourse at all. . Blind to the last cursed affair. Pistols and countless lies. A trail of white blood betrays. The reckless route your craft is running. . Feed 'til the sun turns into wood. Dousing an ancient torch. Loiter the whole day through. And lose yourself in lines dissecting love,calm.

As soon as I got on the horse I forgot about the math.. Forgot about the odds against an adolescent standing up to all of Owen's wrath.. The heat of prairie summer is impossible to take.. I grab the hem and lift the fabric over my sweet head.. I know what you're looking for and I'm never gonna give it to you.. I'm never gonna give it to you.. I'm never gonna give it to you.. . Government rule established by a dazzling light show.. A hegemony armored with a thousand-watt head and seven inches of echo.. I keep up my velocity my spurs are in her sides.. I don't know what I'm doing and it is the only way.. Toward the range I'll ride. I'm never gonna give it to you.. I'm never gonna give it to you.. I'm never gonna give it to you.,lonely.
As the light hits you. Never get out again.,romantic.

As the winter dies the earth is brought to life. And a thousand merchant ships sail to find. A worthy village to land and start again. With one more year for a man to change his ways. .

A strange form of life kicking through windows triggering odds. A strange one,lonely.
As we fall into sequence. And we're eating our young. Remain silent and still for modesty. . When the splints have been broken. And they can't help you now. Do you pray with your eyes closed naturally. . Follow me to nowhere. Woven with the utmost care. . If I'm lost please don't find me. If I drown let me sink. We descended from no one. With a wink. . When it's cold outside hold me. Don't hold me. When I choose to rest my eyes coax me. Don't coax me. When it's cold outside hold me. Don't hold me. When I choose to rest my eyes coax me. Don't coax me. . Follow me to nowhere. Woven with the utmost care. . Have they cleansed you with chloride. And scrubbed behind the knees. Has your body been hollowed by the breeze,high.

At last . My love has come along. My lonely days are over. And life is like a song. . Oh yeah yeah. At last. . The skies above are blue. My heart was wrapped up in clover. The night I looked at you. . I found a dream you smiled. Oh and then the spell was cast. And here we are in heaven. for you are mine.... . At Last,calm.
