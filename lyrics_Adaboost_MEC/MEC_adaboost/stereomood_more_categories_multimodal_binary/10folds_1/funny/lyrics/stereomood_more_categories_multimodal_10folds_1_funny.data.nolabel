And I believe it's time. The great escape from you. Cut-off from all clear lines. You turn it upside down. The stopwatch prophecy. . You try to take it all back. Something will make it go krack. . And I want to tell you then. But then I lose the words. It's neither this nor that. It's all the same. . You try to take it all back. Something will make it go krack. I tried nothing at all. Something will make it go krack. Find more words to throw back. You will clearly need them. Now that I'm back. 'Cause it's hard to soothe sympathy. While our sanity is under attack. . (???). . You try to take it all back. It's all the same. . You try to take it all back. It's all the same
Woke up with rain on my head . Can't drive off so what should I do instead? . Swim to the biggest flower there . To warm(?) you and kiss you<comma> my love . .

Climbed in the world's biggest tree . And then they tried to cut it down . But we didn't make a sound . The sun blinded them . They couldn't see . . Woke up next to you in your bed . Another day to do it all again . Creeped out into the sun . Another day to give you all my love . . Millions of sunsets but the one I'll remember . Millions of sunsets but the one I'll remember . Millions of sunsets but the one I'll remember . Is the one where you told me you'd love me forever

You're driving me crazy<comma> When are you coming home?. (eeeeeeeee eeeeeeeeeee)

[Slug]. If I was a rich man. I'd buy you some shoes. Tall boots for all the dirt you walk through. What would that do?. Enable you to deal. Without schooling you on how to touch what's real. And if I was a smart man. I'd tell you everything that I knew. And give it to you every time you need a talking to. But what would that do?. Teach you my guidelines. So you can be a cheerleader at your game on the sidelines. And if I was a driver. I'd keep my headlights on. To see the difference between right and wrong. I'd wear my seatbelt even when I'm in park. Cause I don't trust the other fools that cruise through these parts. And if I was a better cook. I'd hook up a feast. Set a table full of food for the children to eat. I encourage the nourishment so we can breathe. With the knowledge that we got something accomplished. . Chorus:. And if I was Santa Claus<comma> I'd fight for the cause. Wouldn't expect nothing in return. I'd give you everything you want<comma> I'd be everything you need. So you can take my hand and I can take the lead. . And if I was an honest man. I would stop writing songs. I'd break for a nervous breakdown for breakfast. Tell everyone I knew to stay away from making music. It ain't nothing but a confusing mess (confusing mess). And if I was you<comma> I wouldn't hear a word I said. Wouldn't trust nothing to start it up inside my head. I'd make a conscious effort to live instead. Of trying to kill the monsters that reside underneath the bed. And if I was a hurt man. I'd find a way to put my faith . Into a woman that could take me from today. Maybe. I need somebody that could save me. From the parts of myself that keep making me crazy. And if I was a wise man. I'd climb to the top of the mountain peak. To think about strength versus weakness. I'd find a point that rests a couple of feet above your head. And figure out how I could try to help you reach it. (Ho ho ho). And if I did have a choice. I'd never want to live forever. Just let me have a voice so I can make my points. I can't imagine running a race with no finish line. Just let me keep my pace and make to most of my time. I love giving but I'm bad at receiving. The truth is<comma> I'd prefer to be the one bleeding. But I'm a paranoid that stays between play and work. Cautious and aware<comma> 'cause I'm afraid of being hurt. Which brings me to the issue. And that would be this:. How often must I ask myself why I exist?. I feel like a freak<comma> this world is a circus. Just trying to find myself as well as my purpose. . Chorus:. And if I was Santa Claus<comma> I'd fight for the cause. Wouldn't expect nothing in return. I'd give you everything you want<comma> I'd be everything you need. And you can take my hand and I can take the lead (2x). . I got nothing but gifts. Keep it up in my wits. Got me drunk on the fifth. And now we're stuck in a ditch. And as dumb as it gets. I'mma run you some fibs (?). I wanna touch your lips. I wanna rub your hips. Put a glove on the fist. For the love that exists. We'll keep bumping the hits. To get my bucket of chips. From the Bloods and the Crips. To the skateboarding chicks. Put the Atmosphere on your Christmas wishlist (2x). (Ho ho ho ho)

Sombrero cantava e cercava una sposa. sembra che erano in dieci. quel giorno a seguire nella pampa Sombrero. un colpo di fuoco nel cuore. spezzò la vita del caballero. che amava soffriva rideva moriva. nessuno l'ha visto morire. per questo la gente sa che non è vero. negli occhi di chi ha sofferto. c'è una speranza un amico Sombrero. e cantando le sue canzoni. le storie di sangue le storie d'amore. anche se lui non c'è più. ha lasciato al paese un po' del suo cuore.

You say: "Ere long done do does did". Words which could only be your own. And then produce the text. From whence was ripped. 'Some dizzy whore'<comma> 1804. A dreaded sunny day. So let's go where we're happy. And I meet you at the cemetry gates. Oh Keats and Yeats are on your side. A dreaded sunny day. So let's go where we're wanted. And I meet you at the cemetry gates. Keats and Yeats are on your side. But you lose. 'Cause weird lover Wilde is on mine. (<i>sugar</i>)

As someone sets light to the first fire of autumn. We settle down to cut ourselves apart. Cough and twitch from the news on your face. And some foreign candle burning in your eyes. . Held to the past<comma> too aware of the pending. Chill as the dawn breaks and finds us up for sale. Enter the fog<comma> another low road descending. Away from the cold lust<comma> your house<comma> and summertime. . Blind to the last cursed affair. Pistols and countless lies. A trail of white blood betrays. The reckless route your craft is running. . Feed 'til the sun turns into wood. Dousing an ancient torch. Loiter the whole day through. And lose yourself in lines dissecting love. . Your name on my cast and my notes on your stay. Offer me little but doting on a crime. We've turned every stone and for all our inventions. In matters of love lost<comma> we've no recourse at all. . Blind to the last cursed affair. Pistols and countless lies. A trail of white blood betrays. The reckless route your craft is running. . Feed 'til the sun turns into wood. Dousing an ancient torch. Loiter the whole day through. And lose yourself in lines dissecting love

As soon as I got on the horse I forgot about the math.. Forgot about the odds against an adolescent standing up to all of Owen's wrath.. The heat of prairie summer is impossible to take.. I grab the hem and lift the fabric over my sweet head.. I know what you're looking for and I'm never gonna give it to you.. I'm never gonna give it to you.. I'm never gonna give it to you.. . Government rule established by a dazzling light show.. A hegemony armored with a thousand-watt head and seven inches of echo.. I keep up my velocity my spurs are in her sides.. I don't know what I'm doing and it is the only way.. Toward the range I'll ride<comma> singing<comma> I'm never gonna give it to you.. I'm never gonna give it to you.. I'm never gonna give it to you.. . "I am overrated" said the sculptress to the sea.. "I've been praised for all the ways the marble leaves the man<comma>. And I was wrong to try and free him". And as for me I am a vector I am muscle I am bone.. The sun upon my shoulders and the horse between my legs<comma>. This is all I know.. . My senses are bedazzled by the parallax of the road.. I concentrate to keep contained the overflow.. My knuckles grip so tightly my fingers start to bleed.. If what I have is what you need<comma>. I'm never gonna give it to you.. I'm never gonna give it to you.. I'm never gonna give it to you.
As the descent began I got the distinct impression. Lake Michigan had been frozen for decades. I conducted the warmth from my metronome sternum. To our massive jetting vessel billowing plumes of spent fuel. . The tundra under us cracked and ruptured. To reveal palisades. Made of blades of gray<comma> gray bristling grass. And papulose lichen. I was so frightened. As my grip on you tightened. Your skin got slicker. . I am a deserted bus depot. Though our approach suggested. An American hazy sea. Like the one I found inside. After driving you home once. Still half high. . I-90 through utter desolation. I sense evil at the heart of each far flung well lighted home. I close my eyes and see cellar stairways. Vermiculated with delicate animal bone. . Musty rooms house racks of fur jackets. Spattered with plasma. On a bus in Indiana. I called you and screamed. Under ceaseless patterns of weeping light
As the light hits you<comma>. As you shift along the floor<comma>. I find it hard to place my face.. How did I come to be here<comma> anyway?. It's terribly vague<comma> what's gone before.. . I could have been anyone.. You could have been anyone's dream.. . (dreamer). . Why did you have to choose our moment?. Why did you have to make me feel that?. Why did you make it so unreal?. . . Oh! To be in love<comma>. And never get out again.. Oh! To be in love<comma>. And never get out again.. Oh! To be in love<comma>. Never get out again.. . Oh! To be in love<comma>. And never get out again.. Oh! To be in love<comma>. And never get out again.. Oh! To be in love<comma>. Never get out again.. . . All the colours look brighter now.. Everything they say seems to sound new.. Slipping into tomorrow too quick<comma>. Yesterday always too good to forget.. Stop the swing of the pendulum. Let us through!. . . Oh! To be in love<comma>. And never get out again.. Oh! To be in love<comma>. And never get out again.. Oh! To be in love<comma>. Never get out again.
As the spring is made alive the winter dies. And the final cries of creatures are long behind. And full of spirit the village starts again. With one more year for a man to change his ways. . I used to feel all things around me stir. Grateful for all I received. Taking in the sounds and ways of creatures upon the earth. Great were the rivers I swam waiting out the sun. . As the winter dies the earth is brought to life. And a thousand merchant ships sail to find. A worthy village to land and start again. With one more year for a man to change his ways. . I used to feel all things around me stir. Grateful for all I received. Taking in the sounds and ways of creatures upon the earth. Great were the rivers I swam waiting out the sun. . I used to feel all things around me stir. I’d hear the sound of creatures upon the earth. Grateful for all I received. Though winter cold and spring

A strange form of life kicking through windows<comma> rolling on yards. Heading in loved ones<comma> triggering odds. A strange one. . And a hard way to come into a cabin<comma> into the weather. Into a path walking together. A hard one. . And the softest lips ever<comma> twenty-five years of waiting to kiss them. Smiling and waiting to bend down and kiss twice. The softest lips. . And a dark little room across the nation<comma> you found myself racing. Forgetting the strange and the hard and the soft kiss. In the dark room. . And a strange form of life kicking through windows<comma> rolling on yards. Heading in loved ones<comma> triggering odds. A strange one
As we fall into sequence. And we're eating our young. Remain silent and still for modesty. . When the splints have been broken. And they can't help you now. Do you pray with your eyes closed naturally. . Follow me to nowhere. Woven with the utmost care. . If I'm lost please don't find me. If I drown let me sink. We descended from no one. With a wink. . When it's cold outside hold me. Don't hold me. When I choose to rest my eyes coax me. Don't coax me. When it's cold outside hold me. Don't hold me. When I choose to rest my eyes coax me. Don't coax me. . Follow me to nowhere. Woven with the utmost care. . Have they cleansed you with chloride. And scrubbed behind the knees. Has your body been hollowed by the breeze
