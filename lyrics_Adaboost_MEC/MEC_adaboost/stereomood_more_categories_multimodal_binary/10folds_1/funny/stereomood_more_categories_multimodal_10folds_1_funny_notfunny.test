Don't pull in single harness all your life". . That's what he said<comma> "Don't pull in single harness all your life". . Well a little while later<comma> we come back around there.

All the other girls here are stars - you are the northern lights. They try to shine in through your curtains - you're too close and too bright. They try and they try but everything that they do. Is the ghost of a trace of a pale imitation of you. I'll be the one to drive you back home Kathleen. . This party was made with the night air and the chance that a smile. Will wind its way from your face to one of the boys in your line. You act like you're hip to their tricks and you're strong. But a virgin Wurlitzer heart never once had a song. I'll be the one to drive you back home Kathleen. . And I'll have you back by break of day. I'm going your way anyway. And if you'd like to come along. I'll be yours for a song. . I know you are waiting and I know that it is not for me. But I'm here and I'm ready and I've saved you the passenger seat. I won't be your last dance just your last goodnight. Every heart is a package tangled up in knots someone else tied. I'll be the one to drive you back home Kathleen. . So crawl up your trellis and quietly back into your room. And I'll coast down the length of your drive by the light of the moon. And the next time I see you - a new kind of hello. Both our hearts have a secret only both of us know.

A man made of butterfat. Careening around on a Sno-Cat. And I can't drive any faster. My hands are like ice and the moon shines. On pepper trees and road grease. The yellow lines look blue . . Snow covers Whitehall. White powdered Nembutal. And I can't think any more. My feet are like ice. And the moon sets. On Christmas trees and plastic deer . . I decided to forgive and forget. I thank god you're comatose. As I pull back the bedclothes. And I can't believe my composure. And I can't remember my anger. And summer is a fish story. I wonder where we'll be,0.057875,0.85134,-0.022704,4.748439,0.246336,0.359344,0.307455,0.557622,0.719595,0.025198,1.082441,0.790854,0.431247,0.321352,0.554075,0.180881,0.195541,0.150213,0.732675,0.401879,0.793777,1.314841,3.279086,0.071376,0.103705,0.112155,0.128757,0.120392,13.520828,0.388995,0.775121,0.051213,0.017709,0.035412,0.056517,0.217094,0.349857,12.294641,139.5,1.002968,63.12495,4.239126,1.29824,0.536782,0.426137,0.868633,0.053357,64.41986,5.742696,511.7934,2.33061,0.067978,0.074028,0.102392,0.000606,0.004551,2277.542,1.590794,0,0.635819,0.08962,0,0.231708,0.005614,477.0765,79536.93,1.093455,-2.399473,-2.01457,0.001167,-6.613736,3.088042,-10.54474,-11.48441,-4.128255,3.302697,31.28442,0.350272,0.054644,0.052835,0.001241,0.577551,176.8242,1.598233,21.63421,-1.134009,11.28052,0.002361,6.381202,741,-0.000007,-0.003663,0.782223,0.024263,329,0.756827,24.26388,notfunny
