All there years you've been speaking without breathing. Spinning closer to the sun. Had your way with an unsuspecting public. Little threads are all it takes. La la la la .... I have learned all your secrets so familiar. I know where you lay your head. Fear of god and a disappointing father. Holds the hand around your neck. La la la la .... Sometimes I could just choke myself with laughter. Sometimes everything's so true. So when you come down from your death-defying labors. I'll still be in love with you. La la la la ...,happy.
