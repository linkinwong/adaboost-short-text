'Oh..\r\n\r\nGo to the mountain if you must\r\nGo to the burning bush\r\nHappy would ease your troubled mind\r\nI\'ll be prepared to stay behind\r\n\r\nI know you better than you think I do\r\nDon\'t worry, dear, this is why I fell in love with you\r\nThe man in the looking glass\r\nIs looking back at you at last\r\n\r\nYou can\'t hide from the truth, because the truth is all there is\r\nYou can\'t hide from the truth, because the truth is all there is\r\nYou can\'t hide from the truth, because the truth is all there is\r\nYou can\'t hide...\r\n\r\nIf happy times are too few and far between\r\nIt\'s a pity, dear, we can\'t erase the things we\'ve seen\r\nSo disappear, vanish if you wish\r\nJust go before you\'re swallowed up by bitterness\r\n\r\nAnd the truth is, you can\'t hide from the truth\r\nAnd the truth hurts, because the truth is all there is\r\nI realized some time ago, that I would have to let you go\r\n\r\nMay not be true to say\r\nThat you\'ll return one day\r\nBut in your present state\r\nYou may as well not be here at all\r\nYou wear a thin disguise\r\nIt\'s from yourself you hide\r\nJust take a look at us\r\nWe are heading for a fall\r\n\r\nNow presiding in this court of hip-hop justice\r\nmy rap forte is judge, jury, bailiff, and prosecuting DA\r\nCause ceteris paribus, my modus operandi\r\nit\'s carpe diem whether de facto or de jure\r\nComprende? The people versus you and your sensei\r\nTeaching that style of wordplay, weaker than Wednesday\r\nRegardless of what your friends say, you\'re all dissable\r\nStricken from the record, and deemed inadmissible\r\nWhile this long arm of the law grabs the mic to\r\nShoot dope lines first and ask questions later\r\nThe def sentences of this Live litigator\r\nTo close a case tighter than the jaws of a gator\r\nStenographers are steady logging the jargon\r\nThat your counselors are barking in hopes of a plea bargain\r\nBut when you read back verbatim what they\'re saying to persuade them\r\nYou\'ll realize exactly how I played them\r\nI come with the truth, whole truth, and nothing but\r\n\'Cause the truth hurts just as much as fuckin\' with Live will\r\nI brew skill with refills from now until\r\nPlagiarizing emcees get their flows distilled\r\n\r\nAnd baby, I won\'t die without you by my side\r\nAs long as you return into these arms that burn\r\nAnd baby, I won\'t die, just take a look inside\r\nInto these eyes that burn, come to these arms that yearn\r\nI won\'t die if you leave me high\r\nI won\'t die if you\'re not by my side\r\n\r\nAnd the truth hurts, because the truth is all there is\r\n\r\nYou can\'t hide from the truth\r\n\'Cause the truth is all there is',jazzy
