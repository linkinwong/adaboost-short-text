Kel ki Nhordés da-l é poku pa el. E fla m-e sta mutu mal kalsádu.. Mána bá sidádi grándi . Tiru saí-l pa kulátra..

Oh... . Go to the mountain if you must. Go to the burning bush. Happy would ease your troubled mind. I'll be prepared to stay behind. . I know you better than you think I do. Don't worry<comma> dear<comma> this is why I fell in love with you. The man in the looking glass. Is looking back at you at last. . You can't hide from the truth<comma> because the truth is all there is. You can't hide from the truth<comma> because the truth is all there is. You can't hide from the truth<comma> because the truth is all there is. You can't hide.... . If happy times are too few and far between. It's a pity<comma> dear<comma> we can't erase the things we've seen. So disappear<comma> vanish if you wish. Just go before you're swallowed up by bitterness. . And the truth is<comma> you can't hide from the truth. And the truth hurts<comma> because the truth is all there is. I realized some time ago<comma> that I would have to let you go. . May not be true to say. That you'll return one day. But in your present state. You may as well not be here at all. You wear a thin disguise. It's from yourself you hide. Just take a look at us. We are heading for a fall. . Now presiding in this court of hip-hop justice. my rap forte is judge<comma> jury<comma> bailiff<comma> and prosecuting DA. Cause ceteris paribus<comma> my modus operandi. it's carpe diem whether de facto or de jure. Comprende? The people versus you and your sensei. Teaching that style of wordplay<comma> weaker than Wednesday. Regardless of what your friends say<comma> you're all dissable. Stricken from the record<comma> and deemed inadmissible. While this long arm of the law grabs the mic to. Shoot dope lines first and ask questions later. The def sentences of this Live litigator. To close a case tighter than the jaws of a gator. Stenographers are steady logging the jargon. That your counselors are barking in hopes of a plea bargain. But when you read back verbatim what they're saying to persuade them. You'll realize exactly how I played them. I come with the truth<comma> whole truth<comma> and nothing but. 'Cause the truth hurts just as much as fuckin' with Live will. I brew skill with refills from now until. Plagiarizing emcees get their flows distilled. . And baby<comma> I won't die without you by my side. As long as you return into these arms that burn. And baby<comma> I won't die<comma> just take a look inside. Into these eyes that burn<comma> come to these arms that yearn. I won't die if you leave me high. I won't die if you're not by my side. . And the truth hurts<comma> because the truth is all there is. . You can't hide from the truth. 'Cause the truth is all there is

Tempt me<comma> tempt me<comma> tempt me. Make me need you. Let me long for you. . You'll know what its like when a Man and Woman become One. And the only real way you can do that baby.

A dreaded sunny day. So I meet you at the cemetry gates. Keats and Yeats are on your side. A dreaded sunny day. So I meet you at the cemetry gates. Keats and Yeats are on your side. While Wilde is on mine. So we go inside and we gravely read the stones. All those people<comma> all those lives. Where are they now?. With loves and hates. And passions just like mine. They were born. And then they lived. And then they died. Seems so unfair. I want to cry. You say: "Ere thrice the sun hath done. salutation to the dawn". And you claim these words as your own.

You say: "Ere long done do does did". Words which could only be your own. And then produce the text. From whence was ripped. 'Some dizzy whore'<comma> 1804. A dreaded sunny day. So let's go where we're happy. And I meet you at the cemetry gates. Oh Keats and Yeats are on your side. A dreaded sunny day. So let's go where we're wanted. And I meet you at the cemetry gates. Keats and Yeats are on your side. But you lose. 'Cause weird lover Wilde is on mine. (<i>sugar</i>)
