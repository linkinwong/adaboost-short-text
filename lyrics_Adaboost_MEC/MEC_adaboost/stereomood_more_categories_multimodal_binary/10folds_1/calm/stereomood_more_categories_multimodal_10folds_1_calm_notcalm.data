When all the numbers swim together and all the shadows settle. When doors forced open shut again a flytrap and a petal. My eyes burn and claws rush in to fill them. And in the morning after the night i fall in love with the light. It is so clear i realize and here at last i have my eyes. . When all the figures sound retreat the soft skin starts to shrivel. When dreams made real become less sweet the orchid and the metal. My sex turns and claws rush in to spill them. And in the morning after the night i fall in love with the light. It is so pure i can arrive without the fear of seeing my eyes. . When all the characters full size and every moon is level. When all the spirits burn in lies as center grief by steel. My eyes burn and claws rush in to fill them. But in the morning after the night i fall in love with the light.

It's true. My life has been full of regrets<comma> baby. For me. It's been the only way it could be. Maybe. Remember the night I broke your favorite chair. Perfectly. We threw the pieces into the fire. It was January. . And watched the fire burn through the night. Then woke to ash in winter light. . And I'd drag you off to bed. Sleepyhead. As the sounds of the school yard. Drifted through our dreams. . It's strange going back there. Every one's gone. It's natural. People move out. People pass on. Like my mom. We slept in her hospital room every night. Together. And when she couldn't talk anymore. We sang to her. . And when you're all alone<comma> pretty baby. I'll meet you in the deep. Til you're fast asleep. . And when the cities burning<comma> little baby. I'll climb to your window. And carry you away. . It's true. My life has been full of regrets<comma> baby.

<i><b>Waltzing Matilda</b></i>. Waltzing Matilda whipped out her wallet. The sexy boy smiled in dismay. She took out four twenties 'cause she liked round figures. Everybody's queen for a day.

She creamed in her jeans as he picked up her knees. From off of the formica topped bar. And cascading slowly<comma> he lifted her wholly. And boldly out of this world. And despite people's derision. Proved to be more than diversion. Sha-la-la-la<comma> later on. . And then sha-la-la-la-la<comma> he entered her slowly. And showed her where he was coming from. And then sha-la-la-la-la<comma> he made love to her gently. It was like she'd never ever come. And then sha-la-la-la-la<comma> sha-la-la-la-la. When the sun rose and he made to leave.

Of something or other<comma> hey<comma> man<comma> you know what I mean?. I don't mean to scare you. But you're the one who came here. And you're the one who's gotta take her when you leave. I'm not being smart. Or trying to be cold on my part. And I'm not gonna wear my heart on my sleeve. But you know people get all emotional. And sometimes<comma> man<comma> they just don't act rational you know. They think they're just on TV. . Sha-la-la-la<comma> man. Why don't you just slip her away. . You know<comma> I'm glad that we met man. It really was nice talking. And I really wish that there was a little more time to speak. But you know it could be a hassle. Trying to explain this all to a police officer. About how it was that your old lady got herself stiffed. And it's not like we could help. But there wasn't nothing no one could do. And if there was<comma> man<comma> you know I would have been the first. But when someone turns that blue. Well<comma> it's a universal truth. And then you just know that bitch will never fuck again. By the way<comma> that's really some bad shit. That you came to our place with. But you ought to be more careful around the little girls. It's either the best or it's the worst. And since I don't have to choose. I guess I won't and I know this ain't no way to treat a guest. But why don't you grab your old lady by the feet. And just lay her out in the darkest street. And by morning<comma> she's just another hit and run. You know<comma> some people got no choice. And they can never find a voice. To talk with that they can even call their own. So the first thing that they see. That allows them the right to be. Why they follow it<comma> you know<comma> it's called bad luck. . <i><b>Slipaway</b></i>. Well hey(man)<comma> that's just a lie.

It started out as a feeling. Which then grew into a hope. Which then turned into a quiet thought. Which then turned into a quiet word. . And then that word grew louder and louder. 'Til it was a battle cry. I'll come back. When you call me. No need to say goodbye. . Just because everything's changing. Doesn't mean it's never been this way before. All you can do is try to know who your friends are. As you head off to the war. . Pick a star on the dark horizon. And follow the light. You'll come back. When it's over. No need to say goodbye. . You'll come back . When it's over. No need to say goodbye. . Now we're back to the beginning. It's just a feeling and no one knows yet. But just because they can't feel it too.

While I pass the lonely hours. . I came down from the room. I saw you in the rain. Laughing with some people. Hair dripping down your face. . Your calm hypnotic eyes. Your Scandinavian glow. I felt them like a flame. Candle in my cold bones. . Tonight you were my muse. As I belted and I strummed. Trying not to drown. In the helicopter drone. . Alesund. . From the crowd I heard. You sing a pretty line. Was it there so much longer. That I wanna cry. . I thought about it long. Had you repeated in my ear. "I couldn't place a thought. Without you being so close". . Alesund. . Should've played it then. From the intro to the end. When they offered me the stage. At the bar we landed in. . But I turned and walked. Away from all the fun. And back into the black.

Oh the sisters of mercy. They are not departed or gone. They were waiting for me. When I thought that I just can't go on. And they brought me their comfort . And later they brought me this song. Oh I hope you run into them . You who've been traveling so long. . Yes you who must leave everything . That you cannot control. It begins with your family . But soon it comes round to your soul. Well<comma> I've been where you're hanging. I think I can see how you're pinned. When you're not feeling holy. Your loneliness says that you've sinned. . They lay down beside me. I made my confession to them. They touched both my eyes. And I touched the dew on their hem. If your life is a leaf. That the seasons tear off and condemn. They will bind you with love. That is graceful and green as a stem. . When I left they were sleeping. I hope you run into them soon. Don't turn on the lights. You can read their address by the moon. And you won't make me jealous. If I hear that they sweetened your night. We weren't lovers like that. And besides it would still be all right. . We weren't lovers like that.

Sun been down for days. A pretty flower in a vase. A slipper by the fireplace. A cello lying in its case. . Soon she's down the stairs. Her morning elegance she wears.

Critical eyes are gazing . Fat cows are grazing . My eyes are glazing . How can you see straight with all the lies . I'm too young . You think you're old . Why don't you just hold me cold . I don't like it when you talk about yourself like that . It changes the way that I feel . There'll be no bad dreams . When you're lying next to me . I don't care about the rules . We only answer to ourselves . Answer to ourselves . Why does my sleep tell me of lies . Waking life full of rotten surprise . Why do all the strangers care . Who knows who is there . If you are here and I am where? . Trapped in the cell of your own brain . Blood is scarcely moving through your shriveled veins . Don't let yourself pass you by . It can happen in the blink of an eye . There'll be no bad dreams . When you're lying next to me . I don't care about the rules . We only answer to ourselves . Until we fall awake .

I'm floating down a river. Oars freed from their holes long ago. Lying face up on the floor of my vessel. I marvel at the stars and feel my heart overflow. . Further down the river. Further down the river. Further down the river. Further down the river. . Two weeks without my lover. I'm in this boat alone. Floating down a river named emotion. Will I make it back to shore or drift into the unknown?. . Further down the river. Further down the river. Further down the river. Further down the river. . I'm building an antenna. Transmissions will be sent when I am through. Maybe we could meet again further down the river. And share what we both discovered then revel in the view. . Further down the river.

I am sitting in the morning. At the diner on the corner. I am waiting at the counter. For the man to pour the coffee. . And he fills it only halfway. And before I even argue. He is looking out the window. At somebody coming in. . "It is always nice to see you". Says the man behind the counter. To the woman who has come in. She is shaking her umbrella. . And I look the other way. As they are kissing their hellos. I'm pretending not to see them. And instead I pour the milk. . I open up the paper. There's a story of an actor. Who had died while he was drinking. It was no one I had heard of. . And I'm turning to the horoscope. And looking for the funnies. When I'm feeling someone watching me. And so I raise my head. . There's a woman on the outside. Looking inside . Does she see me?. No she does not really see me. 'Cause she sees her own reflection. . And I'm trying not to notice. That she's hitching up her skirt.

Will wind its way from your face to one of the boys in your line. You act like you're hip to their tricks and you're strong. But a virgin Wurlitzer heart never once had a song. I'll be the one to drive you back home Kathleen. . And I'll have you back by break of day. I'm going your way anyway. And if you'd like to come along. I'll be yours for a song. . I know you are waiting and I know that it is not for me. But I'm here and I'm ready and I've saved you the passenger seat. I won't be your last dance just your last goodnight. Every heart is a package tangled up in knots someone else tied. I'll be the one to drive you back home Kathleen. . So crawl up your trellis and quietly back into your room. And I'll coast down the length of your drive by the light of the moon. And the next time I see you - a new kind of hello. Both our hearts have a secret only both of us know.

Anda my love. Wake up to your window . The day calls in billows . It's echoing moonlight onto the blue nightmare of your heart. In cosy red rainbow . It's shaking off halos .

So we just closed our eyes and dreamed us up a kitchen . And sang another verse to that old song . Come on<comma> Jack<comma> that son-of-a-bitch is comin' . We're desperados waitin' for a train .

And now a road connects the cul-de-sac. To the adjacent development. But there used to be trees stretching back. And there was no way through. . And I was thankful for the mystery. But by the time that girl had hanged herself. I could have looked out my back window. And watched her neck just snap. . Baseball field lights that shine. Over the shedding pine. Each bulb's a blinding sphere. In the secular nation. Unhurried sirens moan. Pitches that glaze my eyes.

And now they are preparing for attack. . I want to fall in love tonight . And form the perfect unbreakable bond. You can be my teenage Jenny Agutter . Swimming naked in a pond. . You know i'm always moanin'. But you jumpstart my seratonin. But how d'you know you've ever really loved?. . But when I feel like this<comma> I know it doesn't matter. When I eat when I'm not hungy I'm sure I feel my face get fatter. Then I thin out every weekend and I think that she might want me. But I always slip off my own 'cause.... .

And if we ever make it home<comma> . I'll tell you all the things that shaped me thus;. Something forged in a phonebox but lost in a restaurant . We've got so much to discuss. .

As soon as I got on the horse I forgot about the math.. Forgot about the odds against an adolescent standing up to all of Owen's wrath.. The heat of prairie summer is impossible to take..

As the descent began I got the distinct impression. Lake Michigan had been frozen for decades. I conducted the warmth from my metronome sternum. To our massive jetting vessel billowing plumes of spent fuel. . The tundra under us cracked and ruptured. To reveal palisades. Made of blades of gray<comma> gray bristling grass. And papulose lichen. I was so frightened. As my grip on you tightened. Your skin got slicker. . I am a deserted bus depot. Though our approach suggested. An American hazy sea. Like the one I found inside. After driving you home once. Still half high. . I-90 through utter desolation. I sense evil at the heart of each far flung well lighted home. I close my eyes and see cellar stairways. Vermiculated with delicate animal bone. . Musty rooms house racks of fur jackets. Spattered with plasma. On a bus in Indiana. I called you and screamed.

at night we crossed the border following a Black robe. to the edge of the reservation—to Cataldo Mission. where the saints and all the martyrs look down on dying converts. <i>what makes the water holy</i> she says <i>is that that it's the closest thing to rain</i>. . I stole the mule from Anthony—I helped Anne up upon it. and we rode to Coeur d'Alene—passed Harrison and Wallace. they were blasting out the tunnels—making way for the light of learning. <i>when Jesus comes a'calling</i> she said <i>he's coming round the mountain on a train</i>. . Yeah. It's my home—last night I dreamt that I grew wings.

Before the world you know was like it is. I held a lover once and I was his. And we walked along the river in the sun. But he's a lonely man<comma> so this was done. The only place we had to meet was night. While the sun he sleeps in shadows we can hide. On the mountainside we spent our time together. But it is gone when morning comes. . And you are the wolf . And I am the moon. And in the endless sky we are but one. We are alive. In my dreams wolf and I. . How many days and nights will come and go. While the only light you'll see is from my glow.
