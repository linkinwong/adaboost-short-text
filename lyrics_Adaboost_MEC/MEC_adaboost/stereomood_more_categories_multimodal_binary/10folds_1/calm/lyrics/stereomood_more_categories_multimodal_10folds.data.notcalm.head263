Baby<comma> I've been waiting. I've been waiting night and day. I didn't see the time. I waited half my life away. There were lots of invitations. And I know you sent me some. But I was waiting. For the miracle<comma> for the miracle to come. . I know you really loved me. But you see my hands were tied. I know it must have hurt you. It must have hurt your pride.

When you know that you've been taken. Nothing left to do. When you're begging for a crumb. Nothing left to do. When you've got to go on waiting. Waiting for the miracle to come. . I dreamed about you<comma> baby. It was just the other night. Most of you was naked. Ah but some of you was light. The sands of time were falling. From your fingers and your thumb.

Yeah let's do something crazy. Something absolutely wrong. While we're waiting. For the miracle<comma> for the miracle to come. . When you've fallen on the highway. And you're lying in the rain. And they ask you how you're doing. Of course you'll say you can't complain. If you're squeezed for information. That's when you've got to play it dumb. You just say you're out there waiting.
