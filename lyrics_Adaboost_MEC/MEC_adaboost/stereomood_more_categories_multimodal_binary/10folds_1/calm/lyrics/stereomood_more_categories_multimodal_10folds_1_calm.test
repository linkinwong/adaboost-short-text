Been round this road so many times . Feel like it's skin is part of mine . This taste of milk is almost gone . Still got my shame<comma> but not for long! . Been wrong so many times before . But never quite like this . And oh<comma> it rained<comma> but the rain all turned to piss. . I hope to make it home one day. I doubt that day will come. I know<comma> by now<comma> that my days they're all gone,notcalm
