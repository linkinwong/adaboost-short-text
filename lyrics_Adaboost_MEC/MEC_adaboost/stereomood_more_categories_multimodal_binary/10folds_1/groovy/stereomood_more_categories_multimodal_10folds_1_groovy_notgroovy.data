"Well I remember as though it were a meal ago<comma>". . Said Tommy the Cat as he reeled back to clear whatever foreign matter. May have nestled its way into his mighty throat.. Many a fat alley rat had met its demise while staring point blank down. The cavernous barrel of this awesome prowling machine.. Truly a wonder of nature this urban predator.. Tommy the Cat had many a story to tell<comma>. But it was a rare occasion such as this that he did.. . "She came slidin' down the alleyway like butter drippin' off a hot biscuit. The aroma<comma> the mean scent<comma> was enough to arouse suspicion in even the. Oldest of tigers that hung around the hot spot in those days. The sight was beyond belief. Many a head snapped double - even triple - takes as this vivacious. Feline made her her way into the delta of the alleyway<comma>. Where the most virile of the young tabbies were known to hang out. . They hung in droves. Such a multitude of masculinity could only be. Found in one place. And that was O'Malley's Alley. . The air was thick with cat calls (no pun intended). But not even a muscle in her neck did twitch. As she sauntered straight into the heart of the alleyway. She knew what she wanted. She was lookin' for that stud bull; she was looking for that he cat. And that was me. . Tommy the Cat is my name and I say unto thee.... . 'Say baby do you wanna lay down with me?. Say baby do you wanna lay down by my side?. Ah baby do you wanna lay down with me?.

And I found myself attached to this railroad track. But I'll come back to you some day. To you. To you. To you. Some day. . And I remember how you told me all you wanted to do. That dream of Paris in the morning or a New York window view. I can see it now you're married and your wife is with a child. And you're all laughing in the garden and I'm lost somewhere in your mind. . If you've got visions of the past. Let them follow you down. They'll come back to you some day. And I found myself attached to this railroad track. But I'll come back to you some day. To you. To you. To you. Some day. . Maybe I should just turn around. Walk away. For no matter how much I really do want to stay. You know I can when it's too late. . Oh I've found myself attached to this railroad track. I'll come back to you some day. To you. To you. To you.

Andalucia when can I see you. When it is snowing out again. Farmer John wants you. Louder and softer closer and nearer. Then again. Needing you taking you keeping you leaving you.

Anda my love. Wake up to your window . The day calls in billows . It's echoing moonlight onto the blue nightmare of your heart. In cosy red rainbow . It's shaking off halos . And the memory of our sacred so and so's. . Oh<comma> take my hand sweet . Complete your release. Unbury your feet . And married we'll be. Alone in receiving ours is a feeling. Not that they would see. They don't know that we could be . Down where your cradle escaped the sea . And your raven-haired mama caught told you so's. . We're laying in the shadow of your family tree . Your haunted heart and me. Brought down by an old idea whose time has come . And in the shadow of the gallows of your family tree . There's a hundred hearts or three. Pumping blood to the roots of evil to keep them young . . Ah me all mine. Is it safe to say that we've waited patiently . Call me on time . And recall the tune that has placed us gracefully . All into line . There's a garden grave and a place there saved for you . I fall by your side . Though your silver-haired mama throws told-you so's . . We're laying in the shadow of your family tree. Your haunted heart and me. Brought down by an old idea whose time has come.

And now a road connects the cul-de-sac. To the adjacent development. But there used to be trees stretching back. And there was no way through. . And I was thankful for the mystery. But by the time that girl had hanged herself. I could have looked out my back window. And watched her neck just snap. . Baseball field lights that shine. Over the shedding pine. Each bulb's a blinding sphere. In the secular nation. Unhurried sirens moan. Pitches that glaze my eyes. She's just a pale fleshy typewriter-light advertisement for a wind chime that emits rays which resonate in the polluted sky. . All entrances to the. Merritt blocked off I mean. I'd love to believe that death's. Just the beginning as the. Shutters fly open and the. Breeze gives me pause. I know what's out there. morning phone calls silence and resentment and craters a new moon built in a line,0.170417,0.080852,3.695023,0.897319,2.018935,1.897892,2.781943,6.222211,0.427976,0.387102,0.412396,1.517683,0.664794,0.0004,0.27319,0.620121,0.713872,0.744761,0.227649,0.210478,0.179156,0.134642,0.132417,0.11856,0.036593,0.087203,0.010157,0.342421,0.277834,0.000147,0.264804,0.564879,0.094097,0.112657,0.119955,0.143253,0.294271,0.00011,0.028617,43.447589,33.614741,79,0.534431,1.005717,0.001086,0.522037,95.96789,6.355222,1.521852,0.621056,1.461705,0.896642,0.100572,54.9183,5.572732,489.6187,2.438197,0.038765,0.019222,0.429166,0.000185,0.01337,7749.863,0.597809,0,0.934088,0.106513,0,0.061609,0.003327,738.7858,360509.7,0.02541,-10.73553,0.290322,17.18342,2.487135,1.532619,14.86583,4.210579,-1.84819,3.79081,11.74771,3.747358,0.105389,0.003956,1.838161,8.937943,0.138299,0.678503,0.296031,0.120271,1.579945,0.045028,0.000049,5.137291,0.000008,5.179565,-2.445179,5.373509,0.000027,0.414162,3.702631,2791,0.221017,0.850484,0.029548,1.067327,1.147307,0.903919,-0.116873,0.000662,-0.296217,-0.000023,notgroovy

And lose yourself in lines dissecting love,0.043019,0.085409,7.864823,0.765062,1.95456,1.993548,2.987302,6.990975,0.398499,0.365779,0.338025,1.419218,0.899613,0.000078,0.265253,0.482832,0.797313,0.663605,0.216411,0.176404,0.145503,0.135112,0.165234,0.164517,0.021829,0.018967,0.011423,0.336371,0.231548,0.000107,0.397016,0.662371,0.131773,0.156944,0.094852,0.127671,0.384648,0.000021,0.030137,13.090723,10.192367,60.75,0.570089,1.003338,0.000892,0.465541,65.01885,3.48089,1.120005,0.704596,0.636227,0.8669,0.095617,187.7205,7.494149,207.1497,0.776334,0.027418,0.102268,0.098714,0.000745,0.007014,17650.03,2.746013,0,0.91478,0.140771,0,0.078009,0.002634,340.6489,22294.17,0.005125,3.21259,0.203824,8.891055,-3.947677,-5.064825,12.13132,3.840849,-1.187261,2.937871,6.707605,2.992167,0.037902,0.000399,4.563146,50.39234,0.163973,0.746462,0.575601,0.174989,0.144323,0.007453,0.000008,10.62255,-0.000003,9.153811,-4.405365,8.307205,-0.000803,0.739215,3.365124,2470,0.169546,0.607101,0.017716,0.798002,0.983714,0.805322,-0.150471,0.00071,-0.372214,-0.000203,notgroovy
As soon as I got on the horse I forgot about the math.. Forgot about the odds against an adolescent standing up to all of Owen's wrath.. The heat of prairie summer is impossible to take.. I grab the hem and lift the fabric over my sweet head.. I know what you're looking for and I'm never gonna give it to you.. I'm never gonna give it to you.. I'm never gonna give it to you.. . Government rule established by a dazzling light show.. A hegemony armored with a thousand-watt head and seven inches of echo.. I keep up my velocity my spurs are in her sides.. I don't know what I'm doing and it is the only way.. Toward the range I'll ride<comma> singing<comma> I'm never gonna give it to you.. I'm never gonna give it to you.. I'm never gonna give it to you.. . "I am overrated" said the sculptress to the sea.. "I've been praised for all the ways the marble leaves the man<comma>. And I was wrong to try and free him". And as for me I am a vector I am muscle I am bone.. The sun upon my shoulders and the horse between my legs<comma>. This is all I know.. . My senses are bedazzled by the parallax of the road.. I concentrate to keep contained the overflow.. My knuckles grip so tightly my fingers start to bleed.. If what I have is what you need<comma>. I'm never gonna give it to you.. I'm never gonna give it to you.. I'm never gonna give it to you.,0.063931,0.09245,7.744743,0.207886,1.817874,2.004045,2.69686,6.460768,0.426679,0.386262,0.383623,1.523918,0.804491,0.00005,0.293229,0.499558,1.001752,0.67289,0.210579,0.19659,0.177238,0.149301,0.134416,0.128091,0.018922,0.019451,0.012999,0.310137,0.28006,0.000044,0.260242,0.529666,0.12097,0.097031,0.094498,0.145488,0.395193,0.000019,0.036857,21.208173,23.835204,81,0.535777,1.005139,0.001035,0.489781,76.03914,4.16298,1.209744,1.008311,1.172067,0.878332,0.066562,27.68218,7.158593,424.894,0.79057,0.014273,0.15092,0.187992,0.000258,0.007105,755.4146,0.687676,0,0.646471,0.086645,0,0.228698,0.00609,414.5472,17908.96,0.008076,-1.339012,0.128866,9.717579,-7.387194,-4.662221,8.336197,4.349853,-6.389498,3.378043,9.011256,2.594442,0.049839,0.000478,1.884953,9.141669,0.130178,0.759253,0.445976,0.145555,0.556813,0.007592,0.000007,5.337102,-0.000001,4.799207,-5.157418,9.942291,-0.000442,0.897671,3.212356,2896,0.288773,0.915097,-0.052217,1.296509,0.972466,1.073833,-0.145401,0.001578,-0.390105,-0.000107,notgroovy
