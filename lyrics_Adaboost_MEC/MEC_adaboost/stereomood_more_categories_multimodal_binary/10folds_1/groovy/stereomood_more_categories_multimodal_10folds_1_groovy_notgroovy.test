Déjà que tu me traites comme un grand enfant. Et nous n'avons plus rien à risquer. À part nos vies qu'on laisse de côté. . Mais il m'aime encore. Et moi je t'aime un peu plus fort. Mais il m'aime encore. Et moi je t'aime un peu plus fort. . C'en est assez de ces dédoublements. C'est plus dur à faire qu'autrement. Car sans rire c'est plus facile de rêver.

Will wind its way from your face to one of the boys in your line. You act like you're hip to their tricks and you're strong. But a virgin Wurlitzer heart never once had a song. I'll be the one to drive you back home Kathleen. . And I'll have you back by break of day. I'm going your way anyway. And if you'd like to come along. I'll be yours for a song. . I know you are waiting and I know that it is not for me. But I'm here and I'm ready and I've saved you the passenger seat. I won't be your last dance just your last goodnight. Every heart is a package tangled up in knots someone else tied. I'll be the one to drive you back home Kathleen. . So crawl up your trellis and quietly back into your room. And I'll coast down the length of your drive by the light of the moon. And the next time I see you - a new kind of hello. Both our hearts have a secret only both of us know.

Alors tu vois comme tout se mêle. Et du cœur à tes lèvres je deviens un casse-tête. Ton rire me crie de te lâcher. Avant de perdre prise et d'abandonner. . Car je ne t'en demanderai jamais autant.

Snow covers Whitehall. White powdered Nembutal. And I can't think any more. My feet are like ice. And the moon sets. On Christmas trees and plastic deer . . I decided to forgive and forget. I thank god you're comatose. As I pull back the bedclothes. And I can't believe my composure. And I can't remember my anger. And summer is a fish story.
