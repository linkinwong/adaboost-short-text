And now a road connects the cul-de-sac. To the adjacent development. But there used to be trees stretching back. And there was no way through. . And I was thankful for the mystery. But by the time that girl had hanged herself. I could have looked out my back window. And watched her neck just snap. . Baseball field lights that shine. Over the shedding pine. Each bulb's a blinding sphere. In the secular nation. Unhurried sirens moan. Pitches that glaze my eyes. She's just a pale fleshy typewriter-light advertisement for a wind chime that emits rays which resonate in the polluted sky. . All entrances to the. Merritt blocked off I mean. I'd love to believe that death's. Just the beginning as the. Shutters fly open and the. Breeze gives me pause.

It's been two years since I've taken this way home. It's comforting to know not much has changed. From the fields we used to roam to sneak into those two abandoned homes. . Everyone's a writer I just have a general block.... There's signs in every yard. But a piece of plastic doesn't tend to make my mind. . I still take bad advice from my best friends. Rather take bad advice from my best friends. And guide a sinking ship to the bottom with them. I'll go to the bottom with you. . Thinking back on thinking forward. I always thought I'd be further than I ever am. Without this bad knee I wouldn't have a good one. These vices don't hold me down. They fucking carry me. . Sometimes I can't believe the things I get myself into. Because laying low has never made much sense to me. . So keep on spinning and I'll stay behind. My closing speech....

The sky is dark. The wind is cold. The night is young. Before it's old and grey. We will know. The trill of it all. The time has come. It's getting late. It's now or never. Don't hesitate or stall. When I call. Don't spoil. The thrill of it all. And before you go to sleep at night. Preying shadows - do they ask you why?. And in the morning through the afternoon. Do you wonder where you're going to?. Every word I use. Each crumpled page. Strange ideas. Mature with age. Like leaves. When autumn falls. Turn gold. Then they hit the ground. Every time I hear. The latest sound. It's pure whiskey. Reeling round and around. My brain. Oh and all o' that jive. It's driving me wild -. The dizzy spin I'm in. Everywhere I look. I see your face. I hear your name. It's all over the place. Hey girl. Though you've gone. Still I recall. The trill of it all. You might as well know what is right for you. And make the most of what you like to do. For all the pleasure that's surrounding you. Should compensate for all you're going through. So if you're feeling fraught. With mental strain. Too much thinking's got you down again. Well let your senses skip. Stay hip. Keep cool. To the thrill of it all. When you try too much. You lose control. Pressure rises. And so I'm told. Something's got the give. Oy Veh. High life ecstasy.

I begin with Culver City. Where the handsome faggots make pretty<comma> pretty. Empty lots<comma> secrets well kept. Nothing standing but the frame of a set. Some things are built to withstand regret. . It was cinematic. How we loved. Longshot! Jumpcut! Close-up!. . She wore off like a prom dress. Heels a kickin'<comma> short hair a mess. Painted nails for turning tricks. Throw something hard<comma> something stick. Throw nothing<comma> no<comma> nothing slips. . Tip and tuck down the 99. The pedal pushed down the entire time. You’re running scared 'til your ceiling falls. Banging her head<comma> wrists rubbed raw. Addicted to something we never saw. . It was cinematic. How we loved. Longshot! Jumpcut! Close-up!. Closeup. Yeah. . Off the freeway Dreamland burns. The ultimate take in the land of returns. With a glycerine smile and a tear for tragedy. Something grand Judy left for me. Nothing more than box office history. . It was cinematic. How we loved. Longshot! Jumpcut! Close-up!. Closeup. Closeup. Yes<comma> Closeup. . I begin where Garland died. Looked like a child all her life. I begin where Garland died. Looked like a child all her life.

Of time. . Wait in the fire. Wait in the fire. . And she weeps on my arm. Walking to the bright lights in sorrow. Oh drink a bit of wine we both might go tomorrow. Oh my love. And the rain is falling and I believe . My time has come. It reminds me of the pain . I might leave . Leave behind. . Wait in the fire. Wait in the fire. . (It reminds me of the pain .

I went out walking the other day. The wind hung wet around my neck. My head it rung with screams and groans. From the night I spent amongst her bones. I passed beside the mission house. Where that mad old buzzard<comma> the reverend<comma>. Shrieked and flapped about life after you're dead. Well<comma> I thought about my friend<comma> Michel. How they rolled him in linoleum. And shot him in the neck. A bloody halo<comma> like a think-bubble. Circling his head. And I bellowed at the firmament. Looks like the rains are hear to stay. And the rain pissed down upon me. And washed me all away. Saying. . Papa won't leave you<comma> Henry. Papa won't leave you<comma> Boy. Papa won't leave you<comma> Henry. Papa won't leave you<comma> Boy. Well<comma> the road is long.

And I went on down the road. He went on down the road. . Well<comma> the moon it looked exhausted. Like something you should pity. Spent an age-spotted. Above the sizzling wires of the city. Well<comma> it reminded me of her face. Her bleached and hungry eyes. Her hair was like a curtain. Falling open with the laughter. And closing with the lies. But the ghost of her still lingers on. Though she's passed through me. And is gone. The slum dogs<comma> they are barking. And the rain children on the streets. And the tears that we will weep today. Will all be washed away. By the tears that we will weep again tomorrow. . Papa won't leave you<comma> Henry. Papa won't leave you<comma> Boy. Papa won't leave you<comma> Henry. Papa won't leave you<comma> Boy. For the road is long. And the road is hard. And many fall by the side. But Papa won't leave you<comma> Henry. So there ain't no need to cry. . And I went on down the road. He went on down the road. And I went on down the road. He went on down the road. . And I came upon a little house. A little house upon a hill. And I entered through<comma> the curtain hissed. Into the house with its blood-red bowels. Where wet-lipped women with greasy fists. Crawled the ceilings and the walls. They filled me full of drink. And led me round the rooms. Naked and cold and grinning. Until everything went black. And I came down spinning. I awoke so drunk and full of rage. That I could hardly speak. A fag in a whale-bone corset. Draping his dick across my cheek. And its into the shame. And its into a guilt. And its into the fucking fray. And the walls ran red around me. A warm arterial spray. Saying. . Papa won't leave you<comma> Henry. Papa won't leave you<comma> Boy. Papa won't leave you<comma> Henry. Papa won't leave you<comma> Boy. Well<comma> the night is dark. And the night is deep. And its jaws are open wide. But Papa won't leave you<comma> Henry. So there ain't no need to cry. . And I went on down the road. He went on down the road. And I went on down the road. He went on down the road. . It's the rainy season where I'm living. Death comes leaping out of every doorway. Wasting you for money<comma> for your clothes. And for your nothing. Entire towns being washed away. Favelas exploding on inflammable spillways. Lynch-mobs<comma> death squads<comma> babies being born without brains. The mad heat and the relentless rains. And if you stick your arm into that hole. It comes out sheared off to the bone. And with her kisses bubbling on my lips. I swiped the rain and nearly missed. And I went on down the road. He went on down the road. Singing. . Papa won't leave you<comma> Henry. Papa won't leave you<comma> Boy. Papa won't leave you<comma> Henry. Papa won't leave you<comma> Boy. Well<comma> the road is long. And the road is hard. And many fall by the side. But Papa won't leave you<comma> Henry. So there ain't no need to cry. . And I went on down the road.

The aroma<comma> the mean scent<comma> was enough to arouse suspicion in even the. Oldest of tigers that hung around the hot spot in those days. The sight was beyond belief. Many a head snapped double - even triple - takes as this vivacious. Feline made her her way into the delta of the alleyway<comma>. Where the most virile of the young tabbies were known to hang out. . They hung in droves. Such a multitude of masculinity could only be. Found in one place. And that was O'Malley's Alley. . The air was thick with cat calls (no pun intended). But not even a muscle in her neck did twitch. As she sauntered straight into the heart of the alleyway. She knew what she wanted. She was lookin' for that stud bull; she was looking for that he cat.

Don't plagiarise or take 'on loan'. There's always someone<comma> somewhere. With a big nose who knows. And who trips you up and laughs. When you fall. Who'll trip you up and laugh. When you fall. You say: "Ere long done do does did". Words which could only be your own. And then produce the text. From whence was ripped. 'Some dizzy whore'<comma> 1804. A dreaded sunny day.

All the other girls here are stars - you are the northern lights. They try to shine in through your curtains - you're too close and too bright. They try and they try but everything that they do. Is the ghost of a trace of a pale imitation of you. I'll be the one to drive you back home Kathleen. . This party was made with the night air and the chance that a smile. Will wind its way from your face to one of the boys in your line. You act like you're hip to their tricks and you're strong. But a virgin Wurlitzer heart never once had a song. I'll be the one to drive you back home Kathleen. . And I'll have you back by break of day. I'm going your way anyway. And if you'd like to come along. I'll be yours for a song. . I know you are waiting and I know that it is not for me. But I'm here and I'm ready and I've saved you the passenger seat. I won't be your last dance just your last goodnight.

A man made of butterfat. Careening around on a Sno-Cat. And I can't drive any faster. My hands are like ice and the moon shines. On pepper trees and road grease. The yellow lines look blue . . Snow covers Whitehall. White powdered Nembutal. And I can't think any more. My feet are like ice. And the moon sets. On Christmas trees and plastic deer . . I decided to forgive and forget. I thank god you're comatose. As I pull back the bedclothes. And I can't believe my composure. And I can't remember my anger. And summer is a fish story.

Andalucia when can I see you. When it is snowing out again. Farmer John wants you. Louder and softer closer and nearer. Then again. Needing you taking you keeping you leaving you. In a year and a day to be sure. That your face doesn't alter. Your words never falter -- I love you. . I'll be here waiting later and later. Hoping the night will go away. Andalucia Castles and Christians. Andalucia come to stay. You were lost<comma> once before<comma> on a day much like this. When you'd made up your mind not to come. And I couldn't persuade you.

And an old school man of the world . He taught me how to drive his car when he was too drunk to . And he'd wink and give me money for the girls . And our lives was like some old western movie . Like desperados waitin' for a train . Like desperados waitin' for a train . . From the time that I could walk<comma> he'd take me with him . To a bar called the Green Frog Cafe . And there was old men with beer guts and dominoes . Lying 'bout their lives while they played . And I was just a kid<comma> but they all called me "sidekick" . Was like desperados waitin' for a train . Like desperados waitin' for a train . . And one day I looked up and he's pushin' eighty . And has brown tobacco stains all down his chin . Well<comma> to me<comma> he's one of the heroes of this country . So why's he all dressed up like them old men . Drinkin' beer and playin' Moon and Forty-two . Just like a desperado waitin' for a train . Like a desperado waitin' for a train . . And then the day before he died I went to see him . I was grown and he was almost gone. So we just closed our eyes and dreamed us up a kitchen . And sang another verse to that old song . Come on<comma> Jack<comma> that son-of-a-bitch is comin' . We're desperados waitin' for a train .

As soon as I got on the horse I forgot about the math.. Forgot about the odds against an adolescent standing up to all of Owen's wrath.. The heat of prairie summer is impossible to take.. I grab the hem and lift the fabric over my sweet head.. I know what you're looking for and I'm never gonna give it to you.. I'm never gonna give it to you.. I'm never gonna give it to you.. . Government rule established by a dazzling light show.. A hegemony armored with a thousand-watt head and seven inches of echo.. I keep up my velocity my spurs are in her sides.. I don't know what I'm doing and it is the only way.. Toward the range I'll ride<comma> singing<comma> I'm never gonna give it to you.. I'm never gonna give it to you..

As the descent began I got the distinct impression. Lake Michigan had been frozen for decades. I conducted the warmth from my metronome sternum. To our massive jetting vessel billowing plumes of spent fuel. . The tundra under us cracked and ruptured. To reveal palisades. Made of blades of gray<comma> gray bristling grass. And papulose lichen. I was so frightened. As my grip on you tightened. Your skin got slicker. . I am a deserted bus depot. Though our approach suggested. An American hazy sea. Like the one I found inside. After driving you home once. Still half high. . I-90 through utter desolation. I sense evil at the heart of each far flung well lighted home. I close my eyes and see cellar stairways. Vermiculated with delicate animal bone. . Musty rooms house racks of fur jackets. Spattered with plasma. On a bus in Indiana. I called you and screamed.

Baby canteen<comma> when i thought your heart stopped beating. The room brought out the silence in your breathing. A birth in wooded housing will help you live beyond the numbers. Let us pray to pan let in the light. And see us bathe and sleep among us. Smell the body of our elders. And wake up to the milky way at breakfast. I'll take the time to pick up all the widow makers broken . No real way to remember if we'll work again. . Color people say oh no<comma> cause they think it's contagious. Marshmallow people say oh yeah<comma> cause they think it's a masterpiece. . The sky has brakes . What a good day to rise. De Soto De Son will time. . Goodbye blue heron goodbye green fly goodbye goodbye. . I've got a raft you'll sail till the open lie in the lake. While your body is broken . When you go out I'll cry in the thicket. Shooting from school. There's a green where the crickets cry mom can't breathe and i know she's leaving. And that the birds of a quay are all good for the crocodile. So slow it down. Its not a race. Death takes time. Do you see it?. . Baby canteen swollen fingers in the water . I roped an Island pony for your birthday. I'll live in wooded housing till they put out all your needles. And drop you in and shelter near the highway,0.071548,0.126292,5.204094,-0.671327,-0.372359,-0.667869,-0.56955,-0.547481,-0.288123,1.978279,3.704769,4.504726,5.977479,0.51081,0.344286,0.385366,0.497392,0.525324,0.466837,0.311637,0.186562,0.282279,0.42131,2.560595,0.301826,1.474591,1.484011,1.652166,2.399105,0.144504,0.183592,0.194586,0.041554,0.045824,0.054355,6.326119,0.928723,0.331585,0.261518,0.277392,0.217572,0.000002,0.199079,0.371373,0.104415,0.141564,0.024831,0.07059,0.118677,0.238241,0.349753,0.076711,0.588478,0.862347,0.031242,0.030098,0.040366,0.079352,3719.386762,8.447446,11.055017,13.007743,1.003675,84.41511,5.094339,1.403113,0.529878,0.704862,0.881129,0.074853,61.86778,5.439697,247.8309,0.353186,0.006719,0.015547,0.026144,0.000197,0.003599,1952.656,0.677888,0,0.968043,0.124894,0,0.030957,0.002239,786.2035,45133.17,0.006323,0.000001,0.005143,1.592515,6.615599,-3.937099,-9.314275,-11.54612,-10.44942,-18.96996,2.745546,-8.238069,-22.30539,-9.231399,-8.4054,-17.51994,29.2907,2.312387,15.1532,13.65018,0.032063,0.084495,0.145553,0.461585,0.212612,2.32427,11.67626,0.751624,0.000561,3.363002,0.466361,0.638545,2453,-0.00271,0.025837,3.470655,0.002336,-0.000001,5.710251,notenergetic

Baby<comma> I've been waiting. I've been waiting night and day. I didn't see the time. I waited half my life away. There were lots of invitations. And I know you sent me some. But I was waiting. For the miracle<comma> for the miracle to come. . I know you really loved me. But you see my hands were tied. I know it must have hurt you. It must have hurt your pride. To have to stand beneath my window. With your bugle and your drum. And me I'm up there waiting. For the miracle<comma> for the miracle to come. . Ah I don't believe you'd like it. You wouldn't like it here. There ain't no entertainment. And the judgments are severe. The maestro says it's Mozart. But it sounds like bubble gum. When you're waiting. For the miracle<comma> for the miracle to come. . Waiting for the miracle. There's nothing left to do. I haven't been this happy. Since the end of World War II. . Nothing left to do.

I dreamed about you<comma> baby. It was just the other night. Most of you was naked. Ah but some of you was light. The sands of time were falling. From your fingers and your thumb.

Yeah let's do something crazy. Something absolutely wrong. While we're waiting. For the miracle<comma> for the miracle to come. . When you've fallen on the highway. And you're lying in the rain. And they ask you how you're doing. Of course you'll say you can't complain. If you're squeezed for information. That's when you've got to play it dumb. You just say you're out there waiting.

Baby's on fire. Better throw her in the water. Look at her laughing. Like a heifer to the slaughter. . Baby's on fire. And all the laughing boys are bitching. Waiting for photos. Oh the plot is so bewitching. . Rescuers row row. Do your best to change the subject. Blow the wind blow blow. Lend some assistance to the object. . Photographers snip snap. Take your time she's only burning. This kind of experience. Is necessary for her learning. . If you'll be my flotsam. I could be half the man I used to. They said you were hot stuff. And that's what baby's been reduced to. . Juanita and Juan. Very clever with maracas. Making their fortunes. Selling secondhand tobaccoes. . Juan dances at Chico's. And when the clients are evicted.

And the smile went along wit dat. Can't truss it. Kickin' wicked rhymes. Like a fortune teller. 'Cause the wickedness done by Jack. Where everybody at. Divided and sold. For liquor and the gold. Smacked in the back. For the other man to mack. Now the story that I'm kickin' is gory. Little Rock where they be. Dockin' this boat. No hope I'm shackled. Plus gang tackled. By the other hand swingin' the rope. Wearin' red<comma> white and blue Jack and his crew. The guy's authorized beat down for the brown. Man to the man<comma> each one so it teach one. Born to terrorize sisters and every brother. One love who said it. I know Whodini sang it. But the hater taught hate. That's why we gang bang it. Beware of the hand. When it's comin' from the left.

<b>Gotye:</b>. Now and then I think of when we were together. Like when you said you felt so happy you could die. I told myself that you were right for me. But felt so lonely in your company. But that was love and it's an ache I still remember. . You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness. Like resignation to the end<comma> always the end. So when we found we could not make sense. Well you said that we would still be friends. But I'll admit that I was glad it was over. . But you didn't have to cut me off. Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing. And I don't even need your love. But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough. . No you didn't have to stoop so low. Have your friends collect your records and then change your number.

Blue textures cascade downward to the base of the monolith. Like brush strokes on a canvas of souls. Two arms reach out a cloak of silent nihil. Revenants untouched by the scythe. They are lost in the dark woods of time. . Aloft in the landscape that you hail. I am the fog that seeps over here in the early hours. . Standing proud in the hollow of the land. A vestige of deeper purity etched in spirit agaisnt the sky. . The menhir had runes carved in limbs of oaken sovereignty. and could see the ages growing from within the palms. I can feel the era slipping into oblivion<comma>. no longer grasping the textures. I am slowly becoming stone. . As wolves celebrate the dusk<comma>. an old voice of wisdom haunts the vale. . Shapes flicker in the fire light through the windows. The woodlands burn with grace. Their silence drowns the age. . As wandering ghosts pass through the flames. A new age of rebirth lights the dawn. . But who are they who pass by the window?. The shapes; like black solar wheels scorched in the snow. by gods of the stone.... This elder stone shall never fall!. . Cast the aeons into the void. So that no other can seek them. No age<comma> no hands shall taint them. Pour the sorrows into the sun. They are lost forever in dark woods of time. Carve the symbols into the stone. So that another can find them. No age<comma> no hands shall change them. Pour the ages into the sun.

Breathe life to the street from the mouth. Those ruby red lips have much to give. Pull life from the land with your capable hands. Those life loving beautiful broken hands. Oh<comma> I'll stand with you and marvel. At the cosmos pink and bright. All the pages flipping backwards. Til time is gone and wrong is right. .

With watery cheeks down flowered lanes. Tattered sails on a ramshackle ship<comma> I'll go pale. Staring straight in the face looming tempest waves. Otherwise I'll wither and die here. On this reach of rubble rambling. With two years filled up with sand<comma> dear. In a broken daze I'll be scrambling. . Like rivers running up the hills and to the sky and down to the sea. Where a merman with a twinkle casts a hook in me. . Summer sky falling into the sea<comma> taking part of me. See the bones on the sand in the light. All the heards of the sea rushing by<comma> pay no mind. To the dancing reflections gone wild. And at night a fractured star fell. And pierced right through the thick of me. I cried out in pain and joy<comma> yes. I'm not dead<comma> not numb<comma> not withering. . Like a falling leaf who keeps her green. I'm turning bright in the sea.
