Been round this road so many times . Feel like it's skin is part of mine . This taste of milk is almost gone . Still got my shame<comma> but not for long! . Been wrong so many times before .

Love is all around. Love is all around you. Love is all around. You don't pay attention<comma>do you?. Love is all around. Love is all around you. Love is all around. There's not much you can do. . Chorus:. No<comma> you don't understand. Hide your head in the sand. What a stupid thing to do. You don't see what others think of you. Sinking in the quicksand. Your happiness comes in cans. You know it isn't true. Aren't you ready for something new?. . Take a look around. I'm the one behind you. Lost in the background. Like a faded tattoo. Can't you hear the sound. Of a heart going underground. Can you hear the sound. Of your heart going underground. . Chorus. . No it's not over. You'll find something better,energetic.
All the other girls here are stars - you are the northern lights. They try to shine in through your curtains - you're too close and too bright. They try and they try but everything that they do. Is the ghost of a trace of a pale imitation of you. I'll be the one to drive you back home Kathleen. . This party was made with the night air and the chance that a smile. Will wind its way from your face to one of the boys in your line. You act like you're hip to their tricks and you're strong. But a virgin Wurlitzer heart never once had a song. I'll be the one to drive you back home Kathleen. . And I'll have you back by break of day. I'm going your way anyway. And if you'd like to come along. I'll be yours for a song. . I know you are waiting and I know that it is not for me. But I'm here and I'm ready and I've saved you the passenger seat. I won't be your last dance just your last goodnight. Every heart is a package tangled up in knots someone else tied. I'll be the one to drive you back home Kathleen. . So crawl up your trellis and quietly back into your room. And I'll coast down the length of your drive by the light of the moon. And the next time I see you - a new kind of hello. Both our hearts have a secret only both of us know. 'Bout the night that I drove you back home Kathleen,energetic.
Lump sat alone in a boggy marsh. Totally motionless except for her heart. Mud flowed up into lump's pajamas. She totally confused all the passing piranhas. . She's lump<comma> she's lump. She's in my head. She's lump<comma> she's lump<comma> she's lump. She might be dead. . Lump lingered last in line for brains. And the ones she got were sorta rotten and insane.

He's a what? He's a what?. He's a newspaper man. And he gets his best ideas. From a newspaper stand. From his boots to his pants. To his comments and his rants. He knows that any little article will do. . Though he expresses some confusion. 'Bout his part in the plan. And he can't understand. That he's not in command. The decisions underwritten. By the cash in his hand. Bought a sweater for his weimariner<comma> too. . Now I'm no mad man. But that's insanity. Feast before famine. And more before family. Goes and shows up with. More bowls and more cups. And the riot for the last hot meal erupts. . Corrupts his hard drive. Through the leanest months. Shells out the hard cash. For the sickest stunts. On aftershave<comma> on gasoline. He flips the page and turns the scene. . In my mind I'm drowning butterflies. Broken dreams and alibis. That's fine. . I've seen my palette blown to monochrome.

Down for the record<comma> but not for freedom. . Angry young mannequin. American<comma> apparently. Still to the rhythm. Better get to the back of me. Can't stand the vision. Better tongue the anatomy. Gold plated overhead. Blank transparency. . In the days of old you were a nut. Now you need three bumps before you cut. Not that I should care about. Nothing I ain't scared of<comma> but. I guess you had to be there. . In my mind I'm breeding butterflies. Broken dreams and alibis. That's fine. . I've seen my palette blown to monochrome.

It's been a long and lonely trip but I'm glad that I took it because it was well worth it.. I got to read a couple books and do some research before I reached my verdict.. Never thought that I was perfect. Always thought that I had a purpose.. Used to wonder if I'd live to see my first kiss.. . The most difficult thing I ever did was recite my own words at a service. Realizing the person I was addressing probably wasn't looking down from heaven.. Or cooking up something in hell's kitchen<comma> trying to listen in or eaves drop from some another dimension.. It was self serving just like this is.. . Conveniently religious on Easter Sunday and on Christmas.. The television went from being a babysitter to a mistress.. Technology made it easy for us to stay in touch while keeping a distance<comma>. 'til we just stayed distant and never touched. Now all we do is text too much.. . I don't remember much from my youth. Maybe my memory is repressed.. Or I just spent too much time wondering if I'd live to have sex.. Fell in love for the first time in 4th grade but I didn't have the courage to talk to her.. In 8th grade I wrote her the note but I slipped it in someone else's locker.. . Considered killing myself 'cause of that.. It was a big deal. It was a blown cover.. It was over for me. My goose was cooked.. Stick a fork in me. The jig is up.. I blew my chances<comma> the rest is history<comma> our future was torn asunder.. It became abundantly clear that I was only brought here to suffer.. . At least I didn't include my name.. Thankfully I wrote the whole note in code. And it had 10 layers of scotch tape safety seal making it impossible to open.. Plus<comma> it was set to self destruct.. Whoever read it probably died…laughing.. I wonder if they lived long enough to realize what happened.. . A year later<comma> I came to understand that wasn't love that I was feeling for her.. I had someone else to obsess over.. I was older. I was very mature.. I forged my time signature while practicing my parents autograph 'cause I was failing math.. Disconnected the phone when I thought the teacher would call my home.. . I checked the mailbox twice a day at the end of a long dirt road.. Steamed open a couple envelopes like I was in private detective mode.. If you snoop around long enough for something in particular you're guaranteed to find it.. For better or worse that's how I learned that it's best to just keep some things private.. . It was the best of times. It was the end of times.. . It was the best of times. It was the end of times.. I was always on deck<comma> I was next in line.. An only child with a pen and pad writing a list of things that I could never have.. The walls in my house were paper thin.. Every squabble seemed to get deafening.. If my memory serves me correctly I made it a point to void and forget some things.. Probably to keep from being embarrassed.. Never meant to upset or give grief to my parents.. Kept my secrets…hid my talents…. In my head<comma> never under the mattress.. . Therapy couldn't break me.. Never learned a word that would insure safety.. So I spoke softly and I tip toed often.. The door to my room was like a big old coffin.. The way that it creeked when I closed it shut.. Anxieties peaked when it opened up.. As if everything that I was thinking would be exposed.. I still sleep fully clothed.. . It was the best of times.. . It was beautiful.. It was brutal.. It was cruel.. It was business as usual.. . Heaven. It was hell.. Used to wonder if I'd live to see 12.. . When I did I figured that I was immortal.. Loved to dance but couldn't make it to the formal.. Couldn't bear watching my imaginary girlfriend. Bust a move with any other dudes.. . Tone Loc was talking bout a "Wild Thang". But I was still caught up in some child thangs.. Scared of a God who couldn't spare the rod.. It was clearly a brimstone and fire thang.. . Pyromaniac. Kleptomaniac.. Couldn't explain my desire to steal that fire.. Now I add it to my rider.. Like "Please oh please don't throw me in that patch of brier!". . It was the best of times. It was the end of times.. . The school counselor was clueless 'cause I never skipped classes.. Perfect attendance. Imperfect accent.. Speech impediment they could never really fix. And I faked bad eyesight so I could wear glasses.. . Considered doing something that would cripple me.. I wanted a wheelchair. I wanted the sympathy.. I wanted straight teeth so then came braces.. 4 years of head gear helped me change faces.. . It was the best of times. It was the end of times.. . Now I wonder if I'll live to see marriage.. Wonder if I'll live long enough to have kids.. Wonder if I'll live to see my kids have kids.. If I do I'm gonna tell 'em how it is.. . "Don't listen when they tell you that these are your best years.. Don't let anybody protect your ears.. It's best that you hear what they don't want you to hear.. It's better to have pressure from peers than not have peers.. Beer won't give you chest hair. Spicy food won't make it curl.. When you think you've got it all figured out and then everything collapses…. Trust me<comma> kid…it's not the end of the world.",energetic.
I must have died. a thousand times. when I get out. I'll rule the earth. . I saw your face in a past life. I'm ready to move on. In a futuristic casket. and you're still alive. . to work it out.

Last night these two bouncers and one of 'em's alright<comma> the other one's the scary one. His way or no way<comma> totalitarian. He's got no time for you looking or breathing how he don't want you to. So step out the queue<comma> he makes examples of you. And there's naught you can say. Behind they go through to the bit where you pay. And you realise then that it's finally the time. To walk back past ten thousand eyes in the line. And you can swap jumpers and make another move.
