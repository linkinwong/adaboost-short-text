I know what's out there. morning phone calls silence and resentment and craters a new moon built in a line

The blue flower was growing from under the ocean. . Then the thunder pulled me away. And the lightning ripped through the sky. All around me<comma> the world was so strange. Like a book I always wanted to write. . In the unseen hand will pick me up. And take me far from home. Lead me through the dream<comma> surround<comma>. And bury me I'll lay there all alone. All alone. . I felt the waves. Coming up from the graves. All the people who knew me. Were all moving through me. . I trembled and shook. As I read from the book. Of that rolling<comma> black water. That end demon's daughter. . Coming down the spiral stairs. With the end of the world in you eyes. No one never could follow you there. The corridors crumble behind

I went out walking the other day. The wind hung wet around my neck. My head it rung with screams and groans. From the night I spent amongst her bones. I passed beside the mission house. Where that mad old buzzard<comma> the reverend<comma>. Shrieked and flapped about life after you're dead. Well<comma> I thought about my friend<comma> Michel. How they rolled him in linoleum. And shot him in the neck. A bloody halo<comma> like a think-bubble. Circling his head. And I bellowed at the firmament. Looks like the rains are hear to stay. And the rain pissed down upon me. And washed me all away. Saying. . Papa won't leave you<comma> Henry. Papa won't leave you<comma> Boy. Papa won't leave you<comma> Henry. Papa won't leave you<comma> Boy. Well<comma> the road is long. And the road is hard. And many fall by the side. But Papa won't leave you<comma> Henry. So there ain't no need to cry. . And I went on down the road. He went on down the road. And I went on down the road. He went on down the road. . Well<comma> the moon it looked exhausted. Like something you should pity. Spent an age-spotted. Above the sizzling wires of the city. Well<comma> it reminded me of her face. Her bleached and hungry eyes. Her hair was like a curtain. Falling open with the laughter. And closing with the lies. But the ghost of her still lingers on. Though she's passed through me. And is gone. The slum dogs<comma> they are barking. And the rain children on the streets. And the tears that we will weep today. Will all be washed away. By the tears that we will weep again tomorrow. . Papa won't leave you<comma> Henry. Papa won't leave you<comma> Boy. Papa won't leave you<comma> Henry. Papa won't leave you<comma> Boy. For the road is long. And the road is hard. And many fall by the side. But Papa won't leave you<comma> Henry. So there ain't no need to cry. . And I went on down the road. He went on down the road. And I went on down the road. He went on down the road. . And I came upon a little house. A little house upon a hill. And I entered through<comma> the curtain hissed. Into the house with its blood-red bowels. Where wet-lipped women with greasy fists. Crawled the ceilings and the walls. They filled me full of drink. And led me round the rooms. Naked and cold and grinning. Until everything went black. And I came down spinning. I awoke so drunk and full of rage. That I could hardly speak. A fag in a whale-bone corset. Draping his dick across my cheek. And its into the shame. And its into a guilt. And its into the fucking fray. And the walls ran red around me. A warm arterial spray. Saying. . Papa won't leave you<comma> Henry. Papa won't leave you<comma> Boy. Papa won't leave you<comma> Henry. Papa won't leave you<comma> Boy. Well<comma> the night is dark. And the night is deep. And its jaws are open wide. But Papa won't leave you<comma> Henry. So there ain't no need to cry. . And I went on down the road. He went on down the road. And I went on down the road. He went on down the road. . It's the rainy season where I'm living. Death comes leaping out of every doorway. Wasting you for money<comma> for your clothes. And for your nothing. Entire towns being washed away. Favelas exploding on inflammable spillways. Lynch-mobs<comma> death squads<comma> babies being born without brains. The mad heat and the relentless rains. And if you stick your arm into that hole. It comes out sheared off to the bone. And with her kisses bubbling on my lips. I swiped the rain and nearly missed. And I went on down the road. He went on down the road. Singing. . Papa won't leave you<comma> Henry. Papa won't leave you<comma> Boy. Papa won't leave you<comma> Henry. Papa won't leave you<comma> Boy. Well<comma> the road is long. And the road is hard. And many fall by the side. But Papa won't leave you<comma> Henry. So there ain't no need to cry. . And I went on down the road.

But not even a muscle in her neck did twitch. As she sauntered straight into the heart of the alleyway. She knew what she wanted. She was lookin' for that stud bull; she was looking for that he cat. And that was me. . Tommy the Cat is my name and I say unto thee.... . 'Say baby do you wanna lay down with me?. Say baby do you wanna lay down by my side?. Ah baby do you wanna lay down with me?.

All the other girls here are stars - you are the northern lights. They try to shine in through your curtains - you're too close and too bright. They try and they try but everything that they do. Is the ghost of a trace of a pale imitation of you. I'll be the one to drive you back home Kathleen. . This party was made with the night air and the chance that a smile. Will wind its way from your face to one of the boys in your line. You act like you're hip to their tricks and you're strong. But a virgin Wurlitzer heart never once had a song. I'll be the one to drive you back home Kathleen. . And I'll have you back by break of day. I'm going your way anyway. And if you'd like to come along. I'll be yours for a song. . I know you are waiting and I know that it is not for me. But I'm here and I'm ready and I've saved you the passenger seat. I won't be your last dance just your last goodnight. Every heart is a package tangled up in knots someone else tied. I'll be the one to drive you back home Kathleen. . So crawl up your trellis and quietly back into your room. And I'll coast down the length of your drive by the light of the moon. And the next time I see you - a new kind of hello. Both our hearts have a secret only both of us know. 'Bout the night that I drove you back home Kathleen
All there years you've been speaking without breathing. Spinning closer to the sun. Had your way with an unsuspecting public. Little threads are all it takes. La la la la .... I have learned all your secrets<comma> so familiar. I know where you lay your head. Fear of god and a disappointing father. Holds the hand around your neck. La la la la .... Sometimes I could just choke myself with laughter. Sometimes everything's so true. So when you come down from your death-defying labors. I'll still be in love with you. La la la la ...

Are you waiting for me?. At the end of the airport. I'm off buying our tickets. Auteur in hibernation. But I'm feeling impatient. We were late for departure. . And the smell of pajamas.

A small Jean Genie snuck off to the city. Strung out on lasers and slash back blazers and. Ate all your razors while pulling the waiters. Talking 'bout Monroe and walking on Snow White.

As someone sets light to the first fire of autumn. We settle down to cut ourselves apart. Cough and twitch from the news on your face. And some foreign candle burning in your eyes. .

The reckless route your craft is running. . Feed 'til the sun turns into wood. Dousing an ancient torch. Loiter the whole day through. And lose yourself in lines dissecting love. .

As soon as I got on the horse I forgot about the math.. Forgot about the odds against an adolescent standing up to all of Owen's wrath.. The heat of prairie summer is impossible to take.. I grab the hem and lift the fabric over my sweet head.. I know what you're looking for and I'm never gonna give it to you.. I'm never gonna give it to you.. I'm never gonna give it to you.. . Government rule established by a dazzling light show.. A hegemony armored with a thousand-watt head and seven inches of echo.. I keep up my velocity my spurs are in her sides.. I don't know what I'm doing and it is the only way.. Toward the range I'll ride<comma> singing<comma> I'm never gonna give it to you.. I'm never gonna give it to you.. I'm never gonna give it to you.. . "I am overrated" said the sculptress to the sea.. "I've been praised for all the ways the marble leaves the man<comma>. And I was wrong to try and free him". And as for me I am a vector I am muscle I am bone.. The sun upon my shoulders and the horse between my legs<comma>. This is all I know.. . My senses are bedazzled by the parallax of the road.. I concentrate to keep contained the overflow.. My knuckles grip so tightly my fingers start to bleed.. If what I have is what you need<comma>. I'm never gonna give it to you.. I'm never gonna give it to you.. I'm never gonna give it to you.
As the descent began I got the distinct impression. Lake Michigan had been frozen for decades. I conducted the warmth from my metronome sternum. To our massive jetting vessel billowing plumes of spent fuel. . The tundra under us cracked and ruptured. To reveal palisades. Made of blades of gray<comma> gray bristling grass. And papulose lichen. I was so frightened. As my grip on you tightened. Your skin got slicker. . I am a deserted bus depot. Though our approach suggested. An American hazy sea. Like the one I found inside. After driving you home once. Still half high. . I-90 through utter desolation. I sense evil at the heart of each far flung well lighted home. I close my eyes and see cellar stairways. Vermiculated with delicate animal bone. . Musty rooms house racks of fur jackets. Spattered with plasma. On a bus in Indiana. I called you and screamed. Under ceaseless patterns of weeping light
As the light hits you<comma>. As you shift along the floor<comma>. I find it hard to place my face.. How did I come to be here<comma> anyway?. It's terribly vague<comma> what's gone before.. . I could have been anyone.. You could have been anyone's dream.. . (dreamer). . Why did you have to choose our moment?. Why did you have to make me feel that?. Why did you make it so unreal?. . . Oh! To be in love<comma>. And never get out again.. Oh! To be in love<comma>. And never get out again.. Oh! To be in love<comma>. Never get out again.. . Oh! To be in love<comma>. And never get out again.. Oh! To be in love<comma>. And never get out again.. Oh! To be in love<comma>. Never get out again.. . . All the colours look brighter now.. Everything they say seems to sound new.. Slipping into tomorrow too quick<comma>. Yesterday always too good to forget.. Stop the swing of the pendulum. Let us through!. . . Oh! To be in love<comma>. And never get out again.. Oh! To be in love<comma>. And never get out again.. Oh! To be in love<comma>. Never get out again.
As the spring is made alive the winter dies. And the final cries of creatures are long behind. And full of spirit the village starts again. With one more year for a man to change his ways. . I used to feel all things around me stir. Grateful for all I received. Taking in the sounds and ways of creatures upon the earth. Great were the rivers I swam waiting out the sun. . As the winter dies the earth is brought to life. And a thousand merchant ships sail to find. A worthy village to land and start again. With one more year for a man to change his ways. . I used to feel all things around me stir. Grateful for all I received. Taking in the sounds and ways of creatures upon the earth. Great were the rivers I swam waiting out the sun. . I used to feel all things around me stir. I’d hear the sound of creatures upon the earth. Grateful for all I received. Though winter cold and spring

A strange form of life kicking through windows<comma> rolling on yards. Heading in loved ones<comma> triggering odds. A strange one. . And a hard way to come into a cabin<comma> into the weather. Into a path walking together. A hard one. . And the softest lips ever<comma> twenty-five years of waiting to kiss them. Smiling and waiting to bend down and kiss twice. The softest lips. .

As we fall into sequence. And we're eating our young. Remain silent and still for modesty. . When the splints have been broken. And they can't help you now. Do you pray with your eyes closed naturally. . Follow me to nowhere. Woven with the utmost care. . If I'm lost please don't find me. If I drown let me sink. We descended from no one. With a wink. . When it's cold outside hold me. Don't hold me. When I choose to rest my eyes coax me. Don't coax me. When it's cold outside hold me. Don't hold me. When I choose to rest my eyes coax me. Don't coax me. . Follow me to nowhere. Woven with the utmost care. . Have they cleansed you with chloride. And scrubbed behind the knees. Has your body been hollowed by the breeze

Baby canteen<comma> when i thought your heart stopped beating. The room brought out the silence in your breathing. A birth in wooded housing will help you live beyond the numbers. Let us pray to pan let in the light. And see us bathe and sleep among us. Smell the body of our elders. And wake up to the milky way at breakfast. I'll take the time to pick up all the widow makers broken . No real way to remember if we'll work again. . Color people say oh no<comma> cause they think it's contagious. Marshmallow people say oh yeah<comma> cause they think it's a masterpiece. . The sky has brakes . What a good day to rise. De Soto De Son will time. . Goodbye blue heron goodbye green fly goodbye goodbye. . I've got a raft you'll sail till the open lie in the lake. While your body is broken . When you go out I'll cry in the thicket. Shooting from school. There's a green where the crickets cry mom can't breathe and i know she's leaving. And that the birds of a quay are all good for the crocodile. So slow it down. Its not a race. Death takes time. Do you see it?. . Baby canteen swollen fingers in the water . I roped an Island pony for your birthday. I'll live in wooded housing till they put out all your needles. And drop you in and shelter near the highway

Basking in low gravity<comma> in a fog.. Wilting in your levity.. Whitewashing avenues of our widening disparities.. We never made a sound just stared at one another.. . The heavy clouds that crowd your head<comma> and above<comma>. Satellites that light the dead darkness of your vacuum.. Your body bleeds in infrared.. . The shadow and the flame run from another.. The river calm and tame sits above the undercurrents.. . Relish in the sound.. The weightless words the heart attracts.. I want it all; no<comma> I want you back; the period a long ellipse.. You can lose the weight but it all comes back
Bass in your face. Not an eight track. Gettin' it good to the wood. So the people. Give you some a dat. Reactin' to the fax. That I kick and it stick. And it stay around. Pointin' to the joint<comma> put the Buddha down. Goin'<comma> goin'<comma> gettin' to the roots. Ain't givin' it up. So turn me loose. But then again I got a story. That's harder than the hardcore. Cost of the holocaust. I'm talin' 'bout the one still goin' on. I know. Where I'm from<comma> not dum diddie dum. From the base motherland. The place of the drum. Invaded by the wack diddie wack. Fooled the black<comma> left us faded. King and chief probably had a big beef. Because of dat now I grit my teeth. So here's a song to the strong. 'Bout a shake of a snake. And the smile went along wit dat. Can't truss it. Kickin' wicked rhymes. Like a fortune teller. 'Cause the wickedness done by Jack. Where everybody at. Divided and sold. For liquor and the gold. Smacked in the back. For the other man to mack. Now the story that I'm kickin' is gory. Little Rock where they be. Dockin' this boat. No hope I'm shackled. Plus gang tackled. By the other hand swingin' the rope. Wearin' red<comma> white and blue Jack and his crew. The guy's authorized beat down for the brown. Man to the man<comma> each one so it teach one. Born to terrorize sisters and every brother. One love who said it. I know Whodini sang it. But the hater taught hate. That's why we gang bang it. Beware of the hand. When it's comin' from the left. I ain't trippin' just watch ya step. Can't truss it. An I judge everyone<comma> one by the one. Look here come the judge. Watch it here he come now. I can only guess what's happ'nin'. Years ago he woulda been. The ships captain. Gettin' me bruised on a cruise. What I got to lose<comma> lost all contact. Got me layin' on my back. Rollin' in my own leftover. When I roll over<comma> I roll over in somebody else's. 90 F--kin' days on a slave ship. Count 'em fallin' off 2<comma> 3<comma> 4 hun'ed at a time. Blood in the wood and it's mine. I'm chokin' on spit feelin' pain. Like my brain bein' chained. Still gotta give it what I got. But it's hot in the day<comma> cold in the night. But I thrive to survive<comma> I pray to god to stay alive. Attitude boils up inside. And that ain't it (think I'll every quit). Still I pray to get my hands 'round. The neck of the man wit' the whip. 3 months pass<comma> they brand a label on my ass. To signify. Owned. I'm on the microphone. Sayin' 1555. How I'm livin'. We been livin' here. Livin' ain't the word. I been givin'. Haven't got. Classify us in the have-nots. Fightin' haves. 'Cause it's all about money. When it comes to Armageddon. Mean I'm getting mine. Here I am turn it over Sam. 427 to the year. Do you understand. That's why it's hard. For the black to love the land. Once again. Bass in your face. Not an eight track. Gettin' it good to the wood. So the people. Give you some a dat. Reactin' to the fax. That I kick and it stick. And it stay around. Pointin' to the joint<comma> put the Buddha down.

Because you were always unnoticed. You were always the flame that dies<comma>. Bastard with a flat-top singing<comma> "The Cloud of Unknowing"<comma>. Bastard with a flat-top singing<comma> "There's a flame<comma> a flame<comma> a flame<comma>. A flame that never dies.". . Because you were always unfocused<comma>. Jinxing the photograph with the pain in your eyes.. Bastard with a flat-top singing<comma> "I shall wait for your love<comma>. I shall wait for your love all days.". Bastard with a casket singing<comma> "I shan't wait for her love<comma>. I shan't wait for her love.". . But you were always:. A saint<comma> a flower in a glove<comma> a night made for the raising of your glass<comma>. The night's going to be a foolin' and a foolin'<comma> but still:. Judith ain't sure<comma>. Toil away<comma> play in the sand<comma> gross out your heart<comma>. The night's going to be made for the la-la-la<comma> but still:. Judith ain't sure.. . You were always unloading<comma>. Soft on the weight of your palm and your hand.. Bastard with a passport to the old destinations<comma>. Bastard with a map of the palm of your hand.. You were always: "Shut him out.". . You were always:. Sun<comma> Dash of White Light<comma>. A night that has passed<comma>. Has passed into the records of all. That the little record keepers fear<comma>. Dear Mary-Anne<comma> Bastard of Light<comma>. I swept your flax bang<comma> I swept into the currents of the river where. Judith ain't sure.. . Oh Man<comma> it was you: did you ever think of a bad idea?. Because the river is bad<comma> the river is cold.. How was the King<comma> was he sad<comma> was he cold<comma> was he low?. . Put your hand on my face<comma> row away from the grief-stricken man<comma>. Put your trust in my fate<comma> I shall track that abrasive wasteland:. We are richer in love<comma> but you know: You just can't have it.
Been on another level. Since you came. No more pain. Look into my eyes. You can't recognize my face. You're up and now. You can stay. You can stay. But you belong to me. You belong to me. . If it hurts to breathe. Open the window. Hold my mind. What's the read. What you came for?. . This is a happy house. We're happy here. In a happy house. Oh this is fun. . These are angel eyes.
