As the descent began I got the distinct impression. Lake Michigan had been frozen for decades. I conducted the warmth from my metronome sternum. To our massive jetting vessel billowing plumes of spent fuel. . The tundra under us cracked and ruptured. To reveal palisades. Made of blades of gray gray bristling grass. And papulose lichen. I was so frightened. As my grip on you tightened. Your skin got slicker. . I am a deserted bus depot. Though our approach suggested. An American hazy sea. Like the one I found inside. After driving you home once. Still half high. . I-90 through utter desolation. I sense evil at the heart of each far flung well lighted home. I close my eyes and see cellar stairways. Vermiculated with delicate animal bone. . Musty rooms house racks of fur jackets. Spattered with plasma. On a bus in Indiana. I called you and screamed. Under ceaseless patterns of weeping light,happy.

Beep beep beep beep beep beep beep. go the horns in the cars in the street. we walked away from the lover's leap. opposite directions. synchronised feet. wait wait wait wait wait wait wait. for the time it takes a heart to mend a break. how many moons are reflected in the lake. can you wait forever if time is all it takes. despite all the warnings. I landed like. a fallen star. in your arms. beat beat beat beat beat beat beat. goes my heart on the side of my sleeve. whispering something I can hardly believe.
