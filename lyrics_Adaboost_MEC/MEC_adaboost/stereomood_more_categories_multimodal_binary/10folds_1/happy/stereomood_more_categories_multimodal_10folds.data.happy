Under ceaseless patterns of weeping light,happy.

One<comma> two<comma> three<comma> four!. I was kidnapped real young by the sweet taste of love. Built a fondness for things that just weren't good enough. I cradled the crow<comma> always shooed off the dove. Which tagged me a naïve son. So the fortunate kids<comma> yeah they left on their lights. And they stuck up their noses and started some fights. Their parents all cackled at dirt on my hands. While my father was slaving<comma> my mother explained it. Sometimes that's just how it is. So my sister went kissing a maple-skinned boy. Finally held up her fists<comma> said "I'm done being coy!". And the neighbourhood<comma> bored<comma> started buzzing with joy. We finally had front-page news. Although it was sad<comma> I couldn't help but laugh. Such ridiculous hate in the hot summer sweat. I laid on my back<comma> let the punk record spin. The sloppy guitar<comma> it was shooting out stars. It all went to my heart<comma> yeah some rainbows in the dark. So I called up danger<comma> my friends and some strangers. They stumbled and wavered<comma> but caught me a saviour. They slipped me the blood in the whole of the vial. But I didn't feel them change. Then I met a man with a fist for a hand. Held me flat on my back<comma> taught me how to give in. Some phrases were shot<comma> pretty roses got tossed. The gift of a fat-lipped grin. Now they're drilling my teeth while I'm soiling sheets. With my lover<comma> she's counting the diamonds on rings. And even when truth doesn't help with the sting. Out of no numbers<comma> some harsh looking colour. You pull them out<comma> feel they're changed. No need for a thousand cranes. So I thank the city<comma> the lights that it's spinning. The friends that I have and the shoes we're not shining. The drunk horn's so violent<comma> all spinning out sounds. But the colour's so vibrant <comma> the colour's so loud. The newly-born crying realizing what life is. In the eyes of my grandpa<comma> right before dying. The see-saw of love<comma> its rickety bounce. The feeling of coming<comma> the feeling of going. The mother<comma> the child<comma> the tame and the wild. The sleeping in minor<comma> the gold leaf<comma> the tire. The crooked<comma> the straight<comma> all the hip and the fake. Oh<comma> I'm finally feeling the stitching of beautiful seams. Sometimes you just can't hold back the river. Sometimes you just can't hold back the river. Sometimes you just can't hold back the river. Sometimes you just can't hold back the river. Hold back the river<comma> hold back the river<comma> hold back the river,happy.

The rain it started tapping. On the window near my bed. There was a loophole in my dreaming. So I got out of it. And to my surprise my eyes were wide and already open. Just my nightstand and my dresser. Where those nightmares had just been. . So I dressed myself and left then . Out into the gray streets. But everything seemed different. And completely new to me. The sky the trees<comma> houses<comma> buildings<comma> even my own body. And each person I encountered . I couldn't wait to meet. . And I came upon a doctor. Who appeared in quite poor health. I said there's nothing that I can do for you  you can't do for yourself. He said oh yes you can<comma> just hold my hand<comma> I think that that would help. So I sat with him awhile. Then I asked him how he felt. . He said I think I'm cured. No<comma> in fact<comma> I'm sure of it. Thank you<comma> stranger . For your therapeutic smile. . So that's how I learned the lesson. That everyone's alone. And your eyes must do some raining. If you're ever gonna grow. And when crying don't help . You can't compose yourself. It's best to compose a poem. An honest verse of longing. Or a simple song of hope. . That's why I'm singing baby don't worry . 'Cause now I got your back. And every time you feel like crying. I'm gonna try and make you laugh. And if I can't . If it just hurts too bad. Then we'll wait for it to pass. And I will keep you company for those days so long and black. . And we'll keep working on the problem. We know we'll never solve. Of love's uneven remainders. Our lives are fractions of a whole. But if the world could remain within a frame. Like a painting on a wall. Then I think we'd see the beauty then. We'd stand staring in awe. . At our still lives posed . Like a bowl of oranges. Like a story told. By the fault-lines and the soil,happy.
