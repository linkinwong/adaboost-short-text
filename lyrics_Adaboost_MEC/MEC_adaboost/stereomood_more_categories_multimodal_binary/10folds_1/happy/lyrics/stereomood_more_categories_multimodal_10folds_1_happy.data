Under ceaseless patterns of weeping light,happy.

One<comma> two<comma> three<comma> four!. I was kidnapped real young by the sweet taste of love. Built a fondness for things that just weren't good enough. I cradled the crow<comma> always shooed off the dove. Which tagged me a naïve son. So the fortunate kids<comma> yeah they left on their lights. And they stuck up their noses and started some fights. Their parents all cackled at dirt on my hands. While my father was slaving<comma> my mother explained it. Sometimes that's just how it is. So my sister went kissing a maple-skinned boy. Finally held up her fists<comma> said "I'm done being coy!". And the neighbourhood<comma> bored<comma> started buzzing with joy. We finally had front-page news. Although it was sad<comma> I couldn't help but laugh. Such ridiculous hate in the hot summer sweat. I laid on my back<comma> let the punk record spin. The sloppy guitar<comma> it was shooting out stars. It all went to my heart<comma> yeah some rainbows in the dark. So I called up danger<comma> my friends and some strangers. They stumbled and wavered<comma> but caught me a saviour. They slipped me the blood in the whole of the vial. But I didn't feel them change. Then I met a man with a fist for a hand. Held me flat on my back<comma> taught me how to give in. Some phrases were shot<comma> pretty roses got tossed. The gift of a fat-lipped grin. Now they're drilling my teeth while I'm soiling sheets. With my lover<comma> she's counting the diamonds on rings. And even when truth doesn't help with the sting. Out of no numbers<comma> some harsh looking colour. You pull them out<comma> feel they're changed. No need for a thousand cranes. So I thank the city<comma> the lights that it's spinning. The friends that I have and the shoes we're not shining. The drunk horn's so violent<comma> all spinning out sounds. But the colour's so vibrant <comma> the colour's so loud. The newly-born crying realizing what life is. In the eyes of my grandpa<comma> right before dying. The see-saw of love<comma> its rickety bounce. The feeling of coming<comma> the feeling of going. The mother<comma> the child<comma> the tame and the wild. The sleeping in minor<comma> the gold leaf<comma> the tire. The crooked<comma> the straight<comma> all the hip and the fake. Oh<comma> I'm finally feeling the stitching of beautiful seams. Sometimes you just can't hold back the river. Sometimes you just can't hold back the river. Sometimes you just can't hold back the river. Sometimes you just can't hold back the river. Hold back the river<comma> hold back the river<comma> hold back the river,happy.

The rain it started tapping. On the window near my bed. There was a loophole in my dreaming. So I got out of it. And to my surprise my eyes were wide and already open. Just my nightstand and my dresser. Where those nightmares had just been. . So I dressed myself and left then . Out into the gray streets. But everything seemed different. And completely new to me. The sky the trees<comma> houses<comma> buildings<comma> even my own body. And each person I encountered . I couldn't wait to meet. . And I came upon a doctor. Who appeared in quite poor health. I said there's nothing that I can do for you  you can't do for yourself. He said oh yes you can<comma> just hold my hand<comma> I think that that would help. So I sat with him awhile. Then I asked him how he felt. . He said I think I'm cured. No<comma> in fact<comma> I'm sure of it. Thank you<comma> stranger . For your therapeutic smile. . So that's how I learned the lesson. That everyone's alone. And your eyes must do some raining. If you're ever gonna grow. And when crying don't help . You can't compose yourself. It's best to compose a poem. An honest verse of longing. Or a simple song of hope. . That's why I'm singing baby don't worry . 'Cause now I got your back. And every time you feel like crying. I'm gonna try and make you laugh. And if I can't . If it just hurts too bad. Then we'll wait for it to pass. And I will keep you company for those days so long and black. . And we'll keep working on the problem. We know we'll never solve. Of love's uneven remainders. Our lives are fractions of a whole. But if the world could remain within a frame. Like a painting on a wall. Then I think we'd see the beauty then. We'd stand staring in awe. . At our still lives posed . Like a bowl of oranges. Like a story told. By the fault-lines and the soil,happy.

Death takes time. Do you see it?. . Baby canteen swollen fingers in the water . I roped an Island pony for your birthday. I'll live in wooded housing till they put out all your needles. And drop you in and shelter near the highway,nothappy

Basking in low gravity<comma> in a fog.. Wilting in your levity.. Whitewashing avenues of our widening disparities.. We never made a sound just stared at one another.. . The heavy clouds that crowd your head<comma> and above<comma>. Satellites that light the dead darkness of your vacuum.. Your body bleeds in infrared.. . The shadow and the flame run from another.. The river calm and tame sits above the undercurrents.. . Relish in the sound.. The weightless words the heart attracts.. I want it all; no<comma> I want you back; the period a long ellipse.. You can lose the weight but it all comes back,nothappy
Bass in your face. Not an eight track. Gettin' it good to the wood. So the people. Give you some a dat. Reactin' to the fax. That I kick and it stick. And it stay around.

And the smile went along wit dat. Can't truss it. Kickin' wicked rhymes. Like a fortune teller. 'Cause the wickedness done by Jack. Where everybody at. Divided and sold. For liquor and the gold. Smacked in the back. For the other man to mack. Now the story that I'm kickin' is gory. Little Rock where they be. Dockin' this boat. No hope I'm shackled. Plus gang tackled. By the other hand swingin' the rope. Wearin' red<comma> white and blue Jack and his crew. The guy's authorized beat down for the brown. Man to the man<comma> each one so it teach one. Born to terrorize sisters and every brother. One love who said it. I know Whodini sang it. But the hater taught hate. That's why we gang bang it. Beware of the hand. When it's comin' from the left. I ain't trippin' just watch ya step. Can't truss it. An I judge everyone<comma> one by the one. Look here come the judge. Watch it here he come now. I can only guess what's happ'nin'. Years ago he woulda been. The ships captain. Gettin' me bruised on a cruise. What I got to lose<comma> lost all contact. Got me layin' on my back. Rollin' in my own leftover. When I roll over<comma> I roll over in somebody else's. 90 F--kin' days on a slave ship. Count 'em fallin' off 2<comma> 3<comma> 4 hun'ed at a time. Blood in the wood and it's mine. I'm chokin' on spit feelin' pain. Like my brain bein' chained. Still gotta give it what I got. But it's hot in the day<comma> cold in the night. But I thrive to survive<comma> I pray to god to stay alive. Attitude boils up inside. And that ain't it (think I'll every quit). Still I pray to get my hands 'round. The neck of the man wit' the whip. 3 months pass<comma> they brand a label on my ass. To signify. Owned. I'm on the microphone. Sayin' 1555. How I'm livin'. We been livin' here. Livin' ain't the word. I been givin'. Haven't got. Classify us in the have-nots. Fightin' haves. 'Cause it's all about money. When it comes to Armageddon. Mean I'm getting mine. Here I am turn it over Sam. 427 to the year. Do you understand. That's why it's hard. For the black to love the land. Once again. Bass in your face. Not an eight track. Gettin' it good to the wood.

A vestige of deeper purity etched in spirit agaisnt the sky. . The menhir had runes carved in limbs of oaken sovereignty. and could see the ages growing from within the palms. I can feel the era slipping into oblivion<comma>. no longer grasping the textures. I am slowly becoming stone. . As wolves celebrate the dusk<comma>. an old voice of wisdom haunts the vale. . Shapes flicker in the fire light through the windows. The woodlands burn with grace. Their silence drowns the age. . As wandering ghosts pass through the flames. A new age of rebirth lights the dawn. . But who are they who pass by the window?. The shapes; like black solar wheels scorched in the snow. by gods of the stone.... This elder stone shall never fall!. . Cast the aeons into the void. So that no other can seek them. No age<comma> no hands shall taint them. Pour the sorrows into the sun.

Palm Desert I wish I could stay.. Palm Desert sages abound.. So head your head to the ground round.. . Meanwhile in the wild west of Hollywood age is losing hold.. Inasmuch as you are touched to have withstood by the very old search for the truth within the bounds of toxicity.. Left unsung so I have strung the frame.,nothappy
