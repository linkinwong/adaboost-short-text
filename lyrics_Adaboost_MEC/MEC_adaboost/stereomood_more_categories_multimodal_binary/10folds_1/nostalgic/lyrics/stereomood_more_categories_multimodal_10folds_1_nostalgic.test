A man made of butterfat. Careening around on a Sno-Cat. And I can't drive any faster. My hands are like ice and the moon shines. On pepper trees and road grease. The yellow lines look blue . . Snow covers Whitehall. White powdered Nembutal. And I can't think any more. My feet are like ice. And the moon sets. On Christmas trees and plastic deer . . I decided to forgive and forget. I thank god you're comatose. As I pull back the bedclothes. And I can't believe my composure. And I can't remember my anger. And summer is a fish story. I wonder where we'll be,notnostalgic
