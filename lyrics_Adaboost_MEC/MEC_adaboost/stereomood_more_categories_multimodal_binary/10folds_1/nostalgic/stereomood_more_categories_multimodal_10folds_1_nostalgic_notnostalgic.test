A man made of butterfat. Careening around on a Sno-Cat. And I can't drive any faster. My hands are like ice and the moon shines. On pepper trees and road grease. The yellow lines look blue . . Snow covers Whitehall. White powdered Nembutal. And I can't think any more. My feet are like ice. And the moon sets. On Christmas trees and plastic deer . . I decided to forgive and forget. I thank god you're comatose. As I pull back the bedclothes. And I can't believe my composure. And I can't remember my anger. And summer is a fish story. I wonder where we'll be,1.582919,0.431247,0.180881,0.161114,0.033081,0.097339,0.142925,0.220974,0.575114,63.12495,4.239126,1.29824,0.536782,0.426137,0.868633,0.053357,64.41986,5.742696,511.7934,2.33061,0.067978,0.074028,0.102392,0.000606,0.004551,2277.542,1.590794,0,0.635819,0.08962,0,0.231708,0.005614,477.0765,79536.93,-2.01457,3.088042,-2.389827,18.00914,0.000002,7.937247,-0.000006,-0.000007,0.008422,0.024263,329,0.756827,-3.767059,-0.000011,0.744577,-4.246922,3.815826,notnostalgic
