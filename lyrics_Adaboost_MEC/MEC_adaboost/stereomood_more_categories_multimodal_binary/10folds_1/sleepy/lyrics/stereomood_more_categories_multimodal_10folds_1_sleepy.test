Would you have taken me upstairs. And turned the lamplight low?. Would I have shown my secret self. And disappeared like the snow?. . Oh<comma> I could have played your little girl. Or I could have played your wife. I could have played your mistress. Running danger down through you life. . I could have played your lady fair. All dressed in lace like the foam from the sea. I could have been your woman of the road. As long as you did not come back home to me. . But as it is<comma> we live in the city. And everything stays in place. Instead we meet on the open sidewalk. And it's well I know your face. . We talk and talk<comma> we tell the truth. There are no shadows here. But when I look into your eyes. I wonder what might have been here. . Because if I had met you on some journey. Where would we be now?,sleepy.
