I lose some sales and my boss won't be happy . But I can't stop listening to the sound . Of two soft voices rendered in perfection . From the reels of this record that I found .

Andalucia when can I see you. When it is snowing out again. Farmer John wants you. Louder and softer closer and nearer. Then again. Needing you taking you keeping you leaving you. In a year and a day to be sure. That your face doesn't alter. Your words never falter -- I love you. . I'll be here waiting later and later. Hoping the night will go away. Andalucia Castles and Christians. Andalucia come to stay. You were lost<comma> once before<comma> on a day much like this. When you'd made up your mind not to come. And I couldn't persuade you. Or wait till tomorrow -- or pass the time,notsleepy
