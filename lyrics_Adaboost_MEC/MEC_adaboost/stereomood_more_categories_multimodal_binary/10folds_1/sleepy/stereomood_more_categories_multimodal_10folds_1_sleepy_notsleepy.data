Every day there's a boy in the mirror . Asking me what are you doing here . Finding all my previous motives . Growing increasingly unclear . . I've travelled far and I've burned all the bridges . I believed as soon as I hit land. All the other options held before me . Will wither in the light of my plan . So I lose some sales and my boss won't be happy. But there's only one thing on my mind . Searching boxes underneath the counter . On a chance that on a tape I'd find . A song for . Someone who needs somewhere . To long for . . Homesick . Cause I no longer know .

Will I make it back to shore or drift into the unknown?. . Further down the river. Further down the river. Further down the river. Further down the river. . I'm building an antenna. Transmissions will be sent when I am through. Maybe we could meet again further down the river. And share what we both discovered then revel in the view. . Further down the river.

I'm losing your train of thought. Watching my mind get lost. Appended to the breeze. Talking amongst the trees. . Cannot find the words to use. The thoughts that I would write. Over-analyzing how the leaves eclipse the light. Constantly find meaning. And naivety inside. Lost within my wonder. As the day turns into night. . All of the mysteries. Conflicts. Discoveries.

Cigarettes and carrot juice. Get yourself a new tattoo. For those sleeveless days of June. I'm sitting on the Cafe Xeno's steps. With a book I haven't started yet. Watching all the girls walk by. .

Why'd you have to come. Why'd you have to come around so soon. I wasn't ready for all this nature. The terrible green<comma> green grass. The violent blooms of flower dresses. And afternoons that make me sleepy. . But we could wait awhile. Before we push that dull turnstile. Into the passage. The thousands they have tread. And others sometimes fled. Before the turn came. . And we could wait our lives. Before a chance arrives. Before the passage. From the top you can see Monterey. Or think about San Jose. Although I know it's not that pleasant. . And hey Jim Kerouac. Brother of the famous Jack. Or so he likes to say<comma> lucky bastard. He's sitting on the cafe's inner steps. With a girl that I'm not over yet. Watching all the world go by. .

All the words are calling. Got time on my own. There's no destination. Wondering whether I'll feel it again. . Keep my hands off the wheel. 'Cause there's nowhere else to go. . Take some time. Just hang around a while. Like to sit this silent moment out. I don't want to lose or let you down. Time's just gonna change itself around. . The autumn leaves are falling. Falling down on me. And there's nothing I can do. And there's nothing I can say. That's gonna change the way I feel. . Keep my hands off the wheel. 'Cause there's nowhere else to go. . Take some time. Just hang around a while. Like to sit this silent moment out. I don't want to lose or let you down. Time's just gonna change itself around. . Take this time. Just hang around awhile. Like to sit this silent moment out. And I don't wanna lose or let you down. Time's just gonna change itself. Change itself around. . I feel it's true. All alone without you. I feel it's true. 'Cause you're running with the wind. And you're running with your life. Won't you come inside?. Inside. . Keep my hands off the wheel. 'Cause there's nowhere else to go. . Take some time.

You fall from a stone and I kiss red lips. And I follow you home. You wipe tears away with your icicle sleeves. And you said goodbye. . Your eyes : They're closing in the night. Your eyes : It's the same story. . You see they're drowning now. You see they've gone cold. You see they're drowning now. You see they hold enough dew. . I wonder if you are the same without me.

If you wake me up tonight . . So you try to make it whole . With everybody here . More than a sony . To make the words throw up . Or show me the way . As they pick me up again . They will be there on the couch . They will make you better still . (can you be sure?) . . Of anything you make . Maybe you can get a whiff . It's enough to make you gag . It's enough to make you sick . Each and every day . With the concrete and the masonry . When the paint that's on is dry . You can work it from your eye . . And you take it from my heart . As you stand alone forever . . From the roaming and the surf . And the cloudy cloudy day . Just a boss thing that is pure . Something specially for you . It's like everybody's needing it . And everybody's sure . . (and if they say) . Is a woman<comma> write this down . Put the paper<comma> over there . More than it is .

As the sounds of the school yard. Drifted through our dreams. . It's strange going back there. Every one's gone. It's natural. People move out. People pass on. Like my mom. We slept in her hospital room every night. Together. And when she couldn't talk anymore. We sang to her. . And when you're all alone<comma> pretty baby. I'll meet you in the deep. Til you're fast asleep. . And when the cities burning<comma> little baby. I'll climb to your window. And carry you away. . It's true. My life has been full of regrets<comma> baby.

20 years of schooling. I just never learned the math. That one and one don't equal two. They often equal half. . I have tried to live the high life. The best that I know how. And I bought my share of debonair. And parlayed it on the crowd. . I do believe that there's no more tricks up my sleeve. The good old days have past and the good times after that. And slowly I've become undone. A stranger with a stranger heart. . Well I plan to hit the bottom. The bottle then the top. And I pray that something quits me. Before I gotta stop. . Cause the masquerade is over. But I was barely there. The mask come off the gilded cloth. Yet I'm just barely there. . I do believe that there's no more tricks up my sleeve.

Don't plagiarise or take 'on loan'. There's always someone<comma> somewhere. With a big nose who knows. And who trips you up and laughs. When you fall. Who'll trip you up and laugh. When you fall. You say: "Ere long done do does did". Words which could only be your own. And then produce the text. From whence was ripped. 'Some dizzy whore'<comma> 1804. A dreaded sunny day. So let's go where we're happy. And I meet you at the cemetry gates. Oh Keats and Yeats are on your side. A dreaded sunny day. So let's go where we're wanted. And I meet you at the cemetry gates.

Ah<comma> the rag man draws circles up and down the block. I'd ask him what the matter was<comma> but I know that he don't talk. And the ladies treat me kindly and they furnish me with tape. But deep inside my heart<comma> I know I can't escape. . Oh<comma> mama. Can this really be the end?. To be stuck inside of Mobile. With the Memphis blues again?. . Well<comma> Shakespeare<comma> he's in the alley with his pointed shoes and his bells. Speaking to some French girl who says she knows me well. And I would send a message to find out if she's talked. But the post office has been stolen and the mailbox is locked. . Oh<comma> mama. Can this really be the end?. To be stuck inside of Mobile. With the Memphis blues again?. . Mona tried to tell me to stay away from the train line. She said that all the railroad men just drink up your blood like wine.

Can this really be the end?. To be stuck inside of Mobile. With the Memphis blues again?. . Grandpa died last week and now he's buried in the rocks. But everybody still talks about how badly they were shocked. But me<comma> I expected it to happen<comma> I knew he'd lost control. When he built a fire on Main Street and shot it full of holes. . Oh<comma> mama. Can this really be the end?. To be stuck inside of Mobile. With the Memphis blues again?. . Now the senator came down here<comma> showing everyone his gun.

Oh<comma> mama. Can this really be the end?. To be stuck inside of Mobile. With the Memphis blues again?. . Now the teen preacher looked so baffled when I asked him why he dressed.

A hundred days have made me older . Since the last time that I saw your pretty face . A thousand lies have made me colder. And I don't think I can look at this the same . But all the miles that separate . They disappear now when I'm dreaming of your face . . I'm here without you baby . But you're still on my lonely mind . I think about you baby . And I dream about you all the time . I'm here without you baby . And you're still with me in my dreams . And tonight it's only you and me yeah. . The miles just keep rollin'.

All the other girls here are stars - you are the northern lights. They try to shine in through your curtains - you're too close and too bright. They try and they try but everything that they do. Is the ghost of a trace of a pale imitation of you. I'll be the one to drive you back home Kathleen. . This party was made with the night air and the chance that a smile. Will wind its way from your face to one of the boys in your line. You act like you're hip to their tricks and you're strong. But a virgin Wurlitzer heart never once had a song. I'll be the one to drive you back home Kathleen. . And I'll have you back by break of day. I'm going your way anyway. And if you'd like to come along. I'll be yours for a song. . I know you are waiting and I know that it is not for me. But I'm here and I'm ready and I've saved you the passenger seat. I won't be your last dance just your last goodnight. Every heart is a package tangled up in knots someone else tied. I'll be the one to drive you back home Kathleen. . So crawl up your trellis and quietly back into your room. And I'll coast down the length of your drive by the light of the moon. And the next time I see you - a new kind of hello. Both our hearts have a secret only both of us know.

Snow covers Whitehall. White powdered Nembutal. And I can't think any more. My feet are like ice. And the moon sets. On Christmas trees and plastic deer . . I decided to forgive and forget. I thank god you're comatose. As I pull back the bedclothes. And I can't believe my composure. And I can't remember my anger. And summer is a fish story.

Andalucia when can I see you. When it is snowing out again. Farmer John wants you. Louder and softer closer and nearer. Then again. Needing you taking you keeping you leaving you.

And recall the tune that has placed us gracefully . All into line . There's a garden grave and a place there saved for you . I fall by your side .

And in the shadow of the gallows of your family tree. There's a hundred hearts or three. Pumping blood to the roots of evil to keep them young. . Now we're gathered in the shadow of your family tree. In halted harmony. Brought down by an old idea whose time has come . And in the shadow of the valley of your family tree. There's a hundred hearts or three.

And I played the Red River Valley . And he'd sit in the kitchen and cry . Run his fingers through seventy years of livin' . And wonder<comma> "Lord<comma> has every well I've drilled gone dry?". We was friends<comma> me and this old man . Was like desperados waitin' for a train . Like desperados waitin' for a train . . Well<comma> he's a drifter and a driller of oil wells . And an old school man of the world . He taught me how to drive his car when he was too drunk to . And he'd wink and give me money for the girls . And our lives was like some old western movie . Like desperados waitin' for a train . Like desperados waitin' for a train . . From the time that I could walk<comma> he'd take me with him . To a bar called the Green Frog Cafe . And there was old men with beer guts and dominoes . Lying 'bout their lives while they played . And I was just a kid<comma> but they all called me "sidekick" . Was like desperados waitin' for a train . Like desperados waitin' for a train . . And one day I looked up and he's pushin' eighty . And has brown tobacco stains all down his chin . Well<comma> to me<comma> he's one of the heroes of this country . So why's he all dressed up like them old men . Drinkin' beer and playin' Moon and Forty-two . Just like a desperado waitin' for a train . Like a desperado waitin' for a train . . And then the day before he died I went to see him . I was grown and he was almost gone. So we just closed our eyes and dreamed us up a kitchen . And sang another verse to that old song . Come on<comma> Jack<comma> that son-of-a-bitch is comin' . We're desperados waitin' for a train .

Each bulb's a blinding sphere. In the secular nation. Unhurried sirens moan. Pitches that glaze my eyes. She's just a pale fleshy typewriter-light advertisement for a wind chime that emits rays which resonate in the polluted sky. . All entrances to the. Merritt blocked off I mean.

And take a little walk when the worst is to come. When I saw you looking like I never thought. And say you're at a loss or forgot. That words can do more than harm. . The town is gonna talk<comma> but these people do not. See things through to the very minimal. But what's it gonna cost to be gone?. If we see you like I hoped we never would. . When eyes can't look at you any other way. Any other way<comma> any other way. When eyes can't look at you any other way. Any other way<comma> any other way. . So take it as a song or a lesson to learn. And sometime soon be better than you were. If you say you're gonna go<comma> then be careful. And watch how you treat every living soul. . My eyes can't look at you any other way. Any other way<comma> any other way. When eyes can't look at you any other way.
