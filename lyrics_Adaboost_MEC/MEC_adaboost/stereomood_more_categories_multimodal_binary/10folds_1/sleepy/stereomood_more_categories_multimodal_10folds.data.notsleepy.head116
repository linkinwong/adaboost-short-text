Always thought she'd stick around. always thought she'd stay. Now he's searching for the ring. the one she had to throw away. beach comber casts a shadow. long as his beard. never thought to cut it since his lover disappeared . she left him in this crazy state he's in . scouring the shoreline oh looking for the ring. oh the ring that was wrapped around her finger. she was just a dream and he was just a dreamer. there's a rhythm to his madness. a rhythm that he's in. retracing all the steps he walked. where once he was a king. his heart jolts awake to the beeps of. his machine starts racing faster faster. till it's a steady stream. he riffles through every grain of sand. one for everything that slipped through his hands. and his friends have all gone. gone with the tide. and he's standing on the shoreline. stranded in time. beach combing for his lost gold. something to have and to hold. oh small fortunes they sat and stay. too long to wash away. sweat dripping from his head. like a bridal shower. and dampening the gleaming sand. but mixed with tears so sour. coz he is just a dreamer . she was just a dream. he is just a dreamer. she was just a dream. he is just a dreamer she is just a dream . she is just a dream his is just a dreamer. she was just a dream . he is just a dreamer,energetic.

A man made of butterfat. Careening around on a Sno-Cat. And I can't drive any faster. My hands are like ice and the moon shines. On pepper trees and road grease. The yellow lines look blue . . Snow covers Whitehall. White powdered Nembutal. And I can't think any more. My feet are like ice. And the moon sets. On Christmas trees and plastic deer . . I decided to forgive and forget. I thank god you're comatose. As I pull back the bedclothes. And I can't believe my composure. And I can't remember my anger. And summer is a fish story. I wonder where we'll be,lonely.
