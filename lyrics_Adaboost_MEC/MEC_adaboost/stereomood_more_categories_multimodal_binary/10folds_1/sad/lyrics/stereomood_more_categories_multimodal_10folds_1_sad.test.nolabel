A dreaded sunny day. So I meet you at the cemetry gates. Keats and Yeats are on your side. A dreaded sunny day. So I meet you at the cemetry gates. Keats and Yeats are on your side. While Wilde is on mine. So we go inside and we gravely read the stones. All those people<comma> all those lives. Where are they now?. With loves and hates. And passions just like mine. They were born. And then they lived. And then they died. Seems so unfair. I want to cry. You say: "Ere thrice the sun hath done. salutation to the dawn". And you claim these words as your own. But I've read well and I've heard them said. A hundred times (maybe less<comma> maybe more). If you must write prose or poems. The words you use should be your own. Don't plagiarise or take 'on loan'. There's always someone<comma> somewhere. With a big nose who knows. And who trips you up and laughs. When you fall. Who'll trip you up and laugh. When you fall. You say: "Ere long done do does did". Words which could only be your own. And then produce the text. From whence was ripped. 'Some dizzy whore'<comma> 1804. A dreaded sunny day. So let's go where we're happy. And I meet you at the cemetry gates. Oh Keats and Yeats are on your side. A dreaded sunny day. So let's go where we're wanted. And I meet you at the cemetry gates. Keats and Yeats are on your side. But you lose. 'Cause weird lover Wilde is on mine. (<i>sugar</i>)

By building up the means for war<comma> we thus preserve the peace. Such bullshit will prepare us for invasion from the east. And meanwhile<comma> they're carving up the land. The anglo-american military have taken full command. It's keeping us fed we're consuming it all. Fat on its culture and military control. Preparing for war bit by bit. Whilst we're watching its telly and eating its shit. They've got it all worked out and we give our consent. They've got it all worked out and we give our consent. They've got it all worked out and we give our consent. They've got it all worked out for Central America. They've got it all worked out for Ireland. By sitting back and keeping silent we give them our consent. Born in the shadow of the USA. Taught the fundamental bullshit every day. Force fed on a diet of Great British lies. Media distortions censor our minds. Passive spectators of royalty. Too diverted to care if we're free. ICI<comma> BP<comma> Thorn EMI. Red<comma> white<comma> and blue logos<comma> British pride. With a Big Mac in one hand and a Coke at our sides. We've accepted their culture and swallowed their lies. They've put up more fences<comma> watched us and spied. And cleverly told us they've got nothing to hide. For too long we've watched them preparing for battle. But the fightback is started little by little. Kicking at the midst of passive defense. Refusing cruise means tearing down fences. At Greenham and Molesworth<comma> fences you can see. But then there's all the barriers that are built around me. Political<comma> economic<comma> cultural<comma> social. And people who live in glass houses. Shouldn't encourage others to throw stones. Let the glossy shop fronts know what to expect. And colonel Sanders<comma> you're next

Coconut Grove . Is a very small cove . Separated from the sea . By a shifting shoal . We didn't realize that . We had arrived . At high tide<comma> high tide . Barely made it out alive . . Red over white . Fishermen working at night . Not even once . Did we see a light . We didn't realize . The forecast had been revised . By moonless skies and. Shifty wind that gusts and dies. . On the sand our keel is heaving . But tonight we've got to be leaving. Travel through the day and into the evening . . Marathon how long we've been gone . And still not yet set foot upon you . . Your low lying shore opens welcomingly. To one who's spent the night at sea. Adrift in the shallows<comma> a modest repose. Adorn with coral<comma> your bright colors show. Ushered in through a bridge that is never closed

Come here my love. This feeling has me spellbound. Yet the storyline<comma> in paragraphs<comma> laid down the same. In fathoms of my inner mind. I'm mystified<comma> oh<comma> by this mood.
