Your face is like the sun. Sinking in to the the ocean. Your face is like watching flowers. Growing in fast motion. . All your kisses are swallowed. Brightened mornings and hollows.

Returning to the earth I can hear the crying. Like Christmas bulbs that I swallowed . Slept in a tree that's gone hollow. And never a brittle winter time. Baby you are my sunshine. My sunshine. Please don't take my sunshine away. . Sunshine. My sunshine. Please don't take my sunshine away
He opens his eyes falls in love at first sight. With the girl in the doorway. What beautiful lines and how full of life. After thousands of years what a face to wake up to. He holds back a sigh as she touches his arm. She dusts off the bed where 'til now he's been sleeping. And under miles of stone<comma> the dried fig of his heart. Under scarab and bone starts back to its beating. . She carries him home in a beautiful boat. He watches the sea from a porthole in stowage. He can hear all she says as she sits by his bed. And one day his lips answer her in her own language. The days quickly pass he loves making her laugh. The first time he moves it's her hair that he touches. She asks<comma> “Are you cursed?” He says<comma> “I think that I'm cured”. Then he talks of the Nile and the girls in bulrushes. . In New York he is laid in a glass covered case. He pretends he is dead people crowd round to see him. But each night she comes round and the two wander down. The halls of the tomb that she calls a museum.

Is writing about him and he makes corrections. . It's his face on her book more and more come to look. Families from Iowa<comma> upper west siders. Then one day it's too much he decides to get up.

She asks<comma> “Are you cursed?” but his answer's obscured. In a sandstorm of flashbulbs and rowdy reporters. . Such reanimation the two tour the nation. He gets out of limos he meets other women. He speaks of her fondly their nights in the museum. But she's just one more rag now he's dragging behind him. She stops going out she just lies there in bed. In hotels in whatever towns they are speaking. Then her face starts to set and her hands start to fold. And one day the dried fig of her heart stops its beating. . Long ago on the ship she asked<comma> “Why pyramids?”. He said<comma> “Think of them as an immense invitation”. She asked<comma> “Are you cursed?” He said<comma> “I think that I'm cured”. Then he kissed her and hoped that she'd forget that question
It’s been a long<comma> long time since. I’ve memorized your face. It’s been four hours now since. I’ve wandered through your place. . And when I sleep on your couch. I feel very safe.

Is the fastest way to reach the shore. On water or land. Riding for the feeling. . What if I had stood there at the end and said again and again. An answer to every question. Riding for the feeling. Would that have been a suitable goodbye?

Are you there up in the sky?. Until the return of my love. This lullaby. . My hope is on the horizon. Every face<comma> it's your eyes I can see. I plead<comma> I pray through each night and day. Our embrace is only a dream. . And as sure as days come from moments. Each hour becomes a life's time. When she'd left I'd only begun this lullaby
Beautiful Tango<comma> take me by the hand.. Beautiful Tango<comma> until you make me dance.. How sweet it can be<comma> if you make me dance?. How long will it last<comma> baby if we dance?. .

For us to show some courage.. . So don't go<comma> if you wanna know.. Don't go<comma> if you don't know.. Don't go<comma> if you wanna know.. Don't go<comma> don't go<comma> don't go.. .

Look what you've done to me. Look at my tears. Forget my heart. No reason to lie to me it can't get any worse. Every little thing that you do to me. Every single day that goes by. Every inch and every mile. Everything that I do takes me away from you. Look what I've done to you. Look at your tears. I forgot your heart No reason to lie to you. It can't get any worse. Every little thing that I do to you. Everything I say breaks your heart. I guess I should have known. I guess I have no choice. I guess I lost your heart. I guess this pain won't stop. I guess I killed my friend. I guess this is the end. Throwing it away We're throwing this all away
The paranoid great movie queen. Sits idly fully armed. The powder and mascara there. A warning light for charm. We see her every movie night. The strong against the weak. The lines come out and struggle with. The empty voice that speaks. . Her heart is oh so tired now. Of kindnesses gone by. Like broken glasses in a drain. Gone down but not well spent. The road from Barbary to here. She sold then stole right back. The vanity<comma> insanity her hungry heart forgave. The fading bride's dull beauty grows. Just begging to be seen. Beneath the magic lights that reach from . Barbary to here. . Her schoolhouse mind has windows now. Where handsome creatures come to watch. The anaesthetic wearing off. Antarctica starts here
Who's next?. Who's next?. . Always the ones the ones. That you least expect. They seem so strong. It turned out she wanted more all along. . And each time I hear who's to part. I examine my heart. See how it stands. Wonder if it's still in safe hands. . Who's fled?. Who's fled?. . Who's been caught. Out in somebody's bed?. I should have guessed. That day that his phone. Wouldn't take your text. . He was a charmer. I wish him bad karma. Oh<comma> I know we shouldn't take sides. But that one was his fault. This one is her fault. No one gets off without paying the ride. . And<comma> oh<comma> the divorces. . And<comma> oh<comma> oh<comma> oh. The honeymoon<comma> the wedding ring. Oh<comma> oh<comma> oh. The afternoon handovers by the swings. . Oh<comma> yes<comma> oh<comma> yes. Your song seemed to look. Through a different lens. You're still so young. Loving's just as easy as it's begun. . Now there's kids to tend. The legal biz. And custody. And<comma> oh<comma> the divorces. . And this one is different. And each one of course is. And always the same. Oh<comma> the divorces. . Who's next?. Who's next?
When I take the prisoners swimming. They have the time of their lives. I love to watch them floating. . On their backs. Unburden and relaxed. . I sit in the tall grass and look the other way. And when I hall them in they always sing. Our sentences will not served. . We are constantly on trial. It's a way to be free. . Most nights I go for a drive. To to the highest place I can find. Stand there on a cliff with goose flesh. Watching the wind rip the leaves of the trees. . Death defying. Every breath. Death defying. . Soon we all be back in the yard. Behind the wall. Leaving heart. Dreaming of cool rivers and tall grass. . We are constantly on trial. It's a way to be free. . We are constantly on trial. It's a way to be free
Listen close and don't be stoned. I'll be here in the morning. Cause I'm just floating. . Your cigarette still burns. Your messed up world will thrill me. Alison<comma> I'm lost. . Alison<comma> I said we're sinking. There's nothing here<comma> but that's okay. Outside your room<comma> your sister's spinning. but she laughs and tells me she's just fine. I guess she's out there somewhere . . And the sailors<comma> they strike poses. The TV covered walls answer slowly. With your talking and your pills. Your messed up life still thrills me. Alison<comma> I'm lost. . Alison<comma> I'll drink your wine. I'll wear your clothes when we're both high. Alison<comma> I said we're sinking. but she laughs and tells me it's just fine. I guess she's out there somewhere

Standing at the punch table swallowing punch. Can't pay attention to the sound of anyone. A little more stupid<comma> a little more scared. Every minute more unprepared. . I made a mistake in my life today. Everything I love gets lost in drawers. I want to start over<comma> I want to be winning. Way out of sync from the beginning. . I wanna hurry home to you. Put on a slow<comma> dumb show for you. And crack you up. So you can put a blue ribbon on my brain. God<comma> I'm very<comma> very frightening. I'll overdo it. . Looking for somewhere to stand and stay. I leaned on the wall and the wall leaned away. Can I get a minute of not being nervous. And not thinking with my dick. . My leg is sparkles<comma> my leg is pins. I better get my shit together<comma> better gather my shit in. You could drive a car through my head in five minutes. From one side of it to the other. . I wanna hurry home to you. Put on a slow<comma> dumb show for you. And crack you up. So you can put a blue ribbon on my brain. God I'm very<comma> very frightening. I'll overdo it. .

Still a little bit of your taste in my mouth. Still a little bit of you laced with my doubt. Still a little hard to say what's going on. . There's still a little bit of your ghost<comma> your witness. Still a little bit of your face I haven't kissed. You step a little closer each day. That I can't say what's going on. . Stones taught me to fly. Love<comma> it taught me to lie. Life<comma> it taught me to die. So it's not hard to fall. When you float like a cannonball. . There’s still a little bit of your song in my ear. There’s still a little bit of your words I long to hear. You step a little closer to me. So close that I can't see what's going on. . Stones taught me to fly. Love<comma> it taught me to lie. Life taught me to die. So it's not hard to fall. When you float like a cannon. . Stones taught me to fly. Love<comma> it taught me to cry. So come on courage<comma> teach me to be shy. 'Cause it's not hard to fall. And I don't want to scare her. It's not hard to fall. And I don't wanna lose. It's not hard to grow. When you know that you just don't know

On the bridge out of Hammond. See them brake lights burning feel my motor turnin. On the bridge out of Hammond. See the big city moon. See how it close comes (x2). Watch my wiper blades pound it like a drum. On the bridge out of Hammond (x2). Think about what's darkening my life (x2). See the light of the afterworld shining on the ruins. It's the light of nowhere else burning to the west. See its sulphery shine (x2). From the bridge out of Hammond (x2). See the big city moon (x3). Between the radio towers. Between the big diesel rigs. In the Midwest's witching hour. I watch the whole town eclipse. From the bridge out of Hammond (x4)
Pain. I guess it's a matter of sensation. But somehow. You have a way of avoiding it all. . In my mind. I have shot you and stabbed you through your heart. I just didn't understand. The ricochet is the second part. . Cause you can't hide. What you intend. It glows in the dark. Once you've sought. The path of revenge. There's no way to stop. And the more I try to hurt you. The more that it hurts me. . Strange. It seems like a character mutation. Though I have all the means . of bringing you fuckers down. I can't make myself. To destroy upon command. Somehow forgiveness . lets the evil make the laws. . No you can't hide. What you intend. It glows in the dark. Once we've become . The thing we dread. There's no way to stop. And the more I try to hurt you. The more it backfires. The more it backfires. The more that it backfires

I think I'm goin' back. To the things I learned so well in my youth. I think I'm returning to. Those days when I was young enough to know the truth. Now there are no games. To only pass the time.

We've got solid state technology. Tapes on the floor. Some songs you can't afford to play. . When we came here today. All I wanted to say. Was how much I miss you. . Alcohol and cotton balls. And some drugs we can't afford on the way. . When we came here today. I felt something true. Now I'm red-eyed and blue
Dear Chicago<comma>. You'll never guess.. You know the girl you said I'd meet someday?. Well<comma> I've got something to confess.. She picked me up on Friday.. Asked me if she reminded me of you.. I just laughed and lit a cigarette<comma>. Said<comma> "That's impossible to do.". Life's gotten simple since.. And it fluctuates so much<comma>. Happy<comma> and sad<comma> and back again.. We're not cryin' out too much.. I think about you all the time<comma>. It's strange and hard to deal.. I think about you lyin' there.. And those blankets lie so still.. Nothing breathes here in the cold<comma>. Nothing moves or even smiles.. I've been thinking some of suicide<comma>. But there's bars out here for miles.. I'm sorry about the every kiss<comma>. Every kiss you wasted bad.. I think the thing you said was true;. I'm gonna die alone and sad.. The wind's feelin' real these days.. And baby<comma> it hurts me some.. I never thought I'd feel so blue.. New York City<comma> you're almost gone.. I think that I've fallen out of love.. I think I've fallen out of love.. I think<comma> I've fallen out of love<comma> with you.
All I want is the best for our lives my dear. And you know my wishes are sincere. What's to say<comma> all the days I cannot bear. . A Sunday smile<comma> we wore it for a while. And at cemetery mile we paused and sang. A Sunday smile<comma> we wore it for a while. And at cemetery mile we paused and sang. About a Sunday smile<comma> and we felt clean. . We burnt to the ground<comma> left a view to admire. Buildings aside<comma> church of white. We burnt to the ground<comma> left a grave to admire. Hills reach for the sky<comma> reach the church of white. . A Sunday smile<comma> we wore it for a while. And at cemetery mile we paused and sang. A Sunday smile<comma> we wore it for a while.

Frozen in the place I hide. Not afraid to paint my sky with. Some who say I've lost my mind. Brother try and hope to find. . You were always so far away. I know that pain so don't you run away. Like you used to do. . Roses in a vase of white. Bloodied by the thorns beside the leaves. That fall because my hand is. Pulling them hard as I can. . You were always so far away. I know that pain. So I won't run away like I used to do. . Pictures in a box at home. Yellowing and green with mold. So I can barely see your face. Wonder how that color taste. . You were always so far away. I know the way so don't you run away. Like you used to do
As someone sets light to the first fire of autumn. We settle down to cut ourselves apart. Cough and twitch from the news on your face. And some foreign candle burning in your eyes. . Held to the past<comma> too aware of the pending. Chill as the dawn breaks and finds us up for sale. Enter the fog<comma> another low road descending. Away from the cold lust<comma> your house<comma> and summertime. . Blind to the last cursed affair. Pistols and countless lies. A trail of white blood betrays. The reckless route your craft is running. . Feed 'til the sun turns into wood. Dousing an ancient torch. Loiter the whole day through. And lose yourself in lines dissecting love. . Your name on my cast and my notes on your stay. Offer me little but doting on a crime. We've turned every stone and for all our inventions. In matters of love lost<comma> we've no recourse at all. . Blind to the last cursed affair. Pistols and countless lies. A trail of white blood betrays. The reckless route your craft is running. . Feed 'til the sun turns into wood. Dousing an ancient torch. Loiter the whole day through. And lose yourself in lines dissecting love
Who's so phony and always surrounded?. Stop your screaming - no one can hear. All the scars on your skin: 'post no bills'. . Who you were. Was so beautiful. Remember who. Who you were. . Hide from the mirror - the cracks and the memories. Hide from your family - they won't know you now. For all the holes in our souls host no thrills. . Who you were. Was so beautiful. Memories who. Who you where
Please fall down. Testing sounds for the death of the forest cold. Trees in clouds testing doubt trying not to be too old. Please you're pride<comma> telling lies<comma> that you're not on your own.

I want you to know. He's not coming back. Look into my eyes. I'm not coming back. . So knives out. Catch the mouse. Don't look down. Shove it in your mouth. . If you'd been a dog. They would've drowned you at birth. Look into my eyes. It's the only way you'll know I'm telling the truth. . So knives out. Cook him up. Squash his head. Put him in the pot. . I want you to know. He's not coming back. He's bloated and frozen. Still there's no point in letting it go to waste. . So knives out. Catch the mouse. Squash his head. Put him in the pot
Oh the night<comma> here it comes again. It's on with the jeans<comma> the jacket and the shirt. How'd I end up feeling so bad. For such a little girl. And I hold you close in the back of my mind. Feels so good but damn it makes me hurt. And I'm too scared to know how I feel about you now. . La Cienega just smiled. See ya around. . And I hold you close in the back of my mind. Raise my glass 'cause either way I'm dead. Neither of you really help me to sleep anymore. One breaks my body and the other breaks my soul. . La Cienega just smiles . As it waves goodbye. . Oh the night<comma> here it comes again. It's off with the jeans<comma> the jacket<comma> and the shirt. How'd I end up feeling so bad. For such a little girl.

And says "I'll see you around"
There's a rainbow on your red bicycle. And I see it in your eyes. You wipe your wet nose with your icicle sleeves. And you fold it twice. . Your eyes : In the middle of the road. Your eyes : It's the same as always. . You see they're drowning now. You see they've gone cold. You see they're drowning now. You see they hold enough dew. . You fall from a stone and I kiss red lips. And I follow you home. You wipe tears away with your icicle sleeves. And you said goodbye. . Your eyes : They're closing in the night. Your eyes : It's the same story. . You see they're drowning now. You see they've gone cold. You see they're drowning now. You see they hold enough dew. . I wonder if you are the same without me. I wonder if you are the same . You said they're all drowning now. . You said I'll shout it out. You said I'll change their view. . You said I'll shout it out. You said I'll change their view. . You said I'll change their view
Close the door<comma> put out the light. Know they won't be home tonight. The snow falls hard and don't you know.

It was the biggest ever cock you'd ever seen<comma> but you've no idea where that cock has been.. You said you were careful - you never were with me.. I heard you did it four times and jonnies come in packs of three.. . She was the best shag I'd ever had.. That doesn't mean I'm saying<comma> bedwise<comma> you were bad.. I think you were working<comma> we got a hotel.. We didn't have anything but I thought I might as well.. . I never told the rest.. I was drunk and I told you I was thinking about a test.. You know I just said it for effect.. Then you laughed and said I'd f**k anything in a skirt once I'm erect.. . And she's a famous harlot in this town.. I know enough to<comma> but still I couldn't turn her down.. He said I'm an arsehole<comma> what was I thinking? . It's far too easy to blame it on the drinking.
Oh the sisters of mercy. They are not departed or gone. They were waiting for me. When I thought that I just can't go on. And they brought me their comfort . And later they brought me this song. Oh I hope you run into them . You who've been traveling so long. . Yes you who must leave everything . That you cannot control. It begins with your family . But soon it comes round to your soul. Well<comma> I've been where you're hanging. I think I can see how you're pinned. When you're not feeling holy. Your loneliness says that you've sinned. . They lay down beside me. I made my confession to them. They touched both my eyes. And I touched the dew on their hem. If your life is a leaf. That the seasons tear off and condemn. They will bind you with love. That is graceful and green as a stem. . When I left they were sleeping. I hope you run into them soon. Don't turn on the lights. You can read their address by the moon. And you won't make me jealous. If I hear that they sweetened your night. We weren't lovers like that. And besides it would still be all right. . We weren't lovers like that. And besides it would still be all right
You always come to the parties. Too bad the feathers are for the birds. On your knees. I will not let you grieve. . I want your picture but not your words. You know the wanting<comma> but there's no verse. On your own. But you can not' call it your home. . We always run our heads too much. We know the reasons<comma> but such and such. On your own<comma>. You will not let your arm go. . We run our fingers together<comma>. you know it's easy the devil's plan. On your own<comma>. You can not call me your heart. . Jack of all trades. Master of none. Cry all the time. Cause i'm not having fun. . You always want to be forgiven. The devil loves what you ask of him. All your needs. But you can not; you will not agree
It stands out on a highway . Like a Creature from another time. It inspires the babies' questions<comma> . (What's that?) . For their mothers as they ride. But no one stopped to think about the babies . Or how they would survive. And we almost lost Detroit . This time. How would we ever get over . Losing our minds? . Just thirty miles from Detroit . Stands a giant power station. It ticks each night as the city sleeps . Seconds from annihilation. But no one stopped to think about the people . Or how they would survive. And we almost lost Detroit . This time . How would we ever get over . Over losing our minds? . The sheriff of Monroe county had. Sure enough disasters on his mind. And what would Karen Silkwood say . If she was still alive? . That when it comes to people's safety . Money wins out every time . And we almost lost Detroit . This time<comma> this time. How would we ever get over . Over losing our minds? . You see<comma> we almost lost Detroit . That time. Almost lost Detroit . That time . And how would we ever get over... . Cause odds are. We gonna lose somewhere<comma> one time. Odds are . We gonna lose somewhere sometime . And how would we ever get over . Losing our minds? . And how would we ever get over . Losing our minds? . Didn't they<comma> didn't they decide? . Almost lost Detroit . That time. . Damn near totally destroyed<comma> . One time. . Didn't all of the world know? . Say didn't you know? . Didn't all of the world know? . Say didn't you know? . We almost lost detroit...
He came dancing across the water. With his galleons and guns. Looking for the new world. And that palace in the sun.. . On the shore lay Montezuma. With his coca leaves and pearls. In his halls he often wandered. With the secrets of the worlds. . . And his subjects gathered 'round him. Like the leaves around a tree. In their clothes of many colors. For the angry gods to see.. . And the women all were beautiful. And the men stood straight and strong. They offered life in sacrifice. So that others could go on.. . Hate was just a legend. And war was never known. The people worked together. And they lifted many stones.. . And they carried them to the flatlands. But they died along the way. And they built up with their bare hands. What we still can't do today.. . And I know she's living there. And she loves me to this day. I still can't remember when. Or how I lost my way.. . He came dancing across the water. Cortez<comma> Cortez. What a killer.
It's four in the morning<comma> the end of December. I'm writing you now just to see if you're better. New York is cold<comma> but I like where I'm living. There's music on Clinton Street all through the evening. . I hear that you're building your little house deep in the desert. You're living for nothing now. I hope you're keeping some kind of record. . Yes<comma> and Jane came by with a lock of your hair. She said that you gave it to her. That night that you planned to go clear. Did you ever go clear?. . Ah<comma> the last time we saw you<comma> you looked so much older. Your famous blue raincoat was torn at the shoulder. You'd been to the station to meet every train. And you came home without Lili Marlene. . And you treated my woman. To a flake of your life. And when she came back. She was nobody's wife. . Well<comma> I see you there with the rose in your teeth. One more thin gypsy thief. Well<comma> I see Jane's awake. She sends her regards. . And what can I tell you<comma> my brother<comma> my killer. What can I possibly say?. I guess that I miss you. I guess I forgive you. I'm glad you stood in my way. . If you ever come by here. For Jane or for me. Your enemy is sleeping. And his woman is free. . Yes<comma> and thanks. For the trouble you took from her eyes. I thought it was there for good so I never tried. . And Jane came by with a lock of your hair. She said that you gave it to her. That night that you planned to go clear . . Sincerely<comma> L. Cohen
two blue lights. one’s the blue light of the late night bus. one’s the blue light of the moon over us. one’s got the diesel fuel on her breath. one’s got the damp taste of the earth on it. two blue lights. there’s a dead archer in the tower you can’t hear it but you can tell. when the bells ring twelve times in hell the bells ring twelve times in this town as well. two blue lights (x2)
I lost myself on a cool damp night. Gave myself in that misty light. Was hypnotized by a strange delight. Under a lilac tree. I made wine from the lilac tree. Put my heart in its recipe. It makes me see what I want to see. and be what I want to be. When I think more than I want to think. Do things I never should do. I drink much more that I ought to drink. Because (it) brings me back you.... . Lilac wine is sweet and heady<comma> like my love. Lilac wine<comma> I feel unsteady<comma> like my love. Listen to me... I cannot see clearly. Isn't that she coming to me nearly here?. Lilac wine is sweet and heady where's my love?. Lilac wine<comma> I feel unsteady<comma> where's my love?. Listen to me<comma> why is everything so hazy?. Isn't that she<comma> or am I just going crazy<comma> dear?. Lilac Wine<comma> I feel unready for my love...
In the hall I heard your faints falling. your trial and my corrections made. . You have all the prayers of my loose heart.. You have all the prayers of my. . No I was not there on the church stairs.. The wind in my hair<comma> a flood through my tear. No I was not there on the church stairs.. The wind in my hair<comma> a flood through my tear. . Me<comma> I wanted<comma> I wanted the right time. Me<comma> I wanted<comma> I wanted the fire in line. Me<comma> I wanted<comma> I wanted the right time. Me<comma> I wanted<comma> I wanted the fire in line

is your jewellery still lost in the sand. out on the coast<comma> or rushed into the brine?. you left your rings on the shoreline. so you wouldn't lose them swimming in the shallows. . a plastic shovel<comma> soft sweaty children far from home. on vacation not unlike your very own. . and the Captain Howdy lit upon my shoulder. and he left me with sulphur and rooms full of headaches. I fell in with snakes in the poisoned ranks of strangers. please send me more yellow birds for the dim interior. . will my pony recognise my voice in hell?. will he still be blind<comma> or do they go by smell?. will you promise not to rest me out at sea. but on a fiery river boat that's rickety?. . I'll never find my pony along the rolling swell. a muddy river or a lake would do me well. with hints of amber sundowns and moody thunderstorms. a sunken barge's horns<comma> with the cold rusty bells
Reeling the liars in. We are reeling the liars in. We are removing their face<comma> collecting their skin<comma> we are reeling the liars in. We are burning them in a pile.

I'd swim across Lake Michigan. I'd sell my shoes. I'd give my body to be back again. In the rest of the room. . To be alone with you. To be alone with you. To be alone with you. To be alone with you. . You gave your body to the lonely. They took your clothes. You gave up a wife and a family. You gave your ghost. . To be alone with me. To be alone with me. To be alone with me. And went up on a tree. . To be alone with me and went up on the tree. I've never known a man who loved me

I'm here again. A thousand miles away from you . A broken mess<comma> just scattered pieces of who I am. I tried so hard. Thought I could do this on my own . I've lost so much along the way . . Then I'll see your face. I know I'm finally yours . I find everything I thought I lost before . You call my name . I come to you in pieces . So you can make me whole. . I've come undone .

Scoot and make as was. Smell come in on the train. Then dunk in sacrone. Left at trow's ennui. All ours anchor. To the aching bone. Programmed without form. Programmed without sound. . Austere known your pen. Throats inside of glass. Hanging next to me. Eyes all disappear. Gloss tones speak in turn. Chew in such a rush. Lands strength a rolling home. Lie doesn't hold mass. . I found myself awake and walking. The two of you arrive. Backs turned to the spitting. But they have not a dream. No one was there. Look towards the face. Becoming very clear
I must be careful now in my steps . Years of calculations and the stress . My science is waiting<comma> nearly complete . One glass will last for nearly a week . .

I never thought that I could be so bold. To even say these thoughts aloud. I see you with your man<comma> your eyes just shine. While he stands tall and walking proud. . That look you give that guy. I wanna see looking right at me. If I could be that guy instead of me. I'd never let you down. . It always seems like you're going somewhere. Better than you've been before. While I go to sleep and I dream all night. Of you knocking on my door. . That look you give that guy. I wanna see looking right at me. If I could be that guy instead of me. I'd be all I can be. I'd be all I can be. . I'm nothing like what I'd like to be. I'm nothing much I know it's true. I lack the style and the pedigree. And my chances are so few. . That look you give that guy.

It started out as a feeling. Which then grew into a hope. Which then turned into a quiet thought. Which then turned into a quiet word. . And then that word grew louder and louder. 'Til it was a battle cry. I'll come back. When you call me. No need to say goodbye. . Just because everything's changing. Doesn't mean it's never been this way before. All you can do is try to know who your friends are. As you head off to the war. . Pick a star on the dark horizon. And follow the light. You'll come back. When it's over. No need to say goodbye. . You'll come back . When it's over. No need to say goodbye. . Now we're back to the beginning. It's just a feeling and no one knows yet. But just because they can't feel it too.

When they call you. No need to say goodbye
The car's on fire and there's no driver at the wheel. And the sewers are all muddied with a thousand lonely suicides. And a dark wind blows. . The government is corrupt. And we're on so many drugs. With the radio on and the curtains drawn. . We're trapped in the belly of this horrible machine. And the machine is bleeding to death. . The sun has fallen down. And the billboards are all leering. And the flags are all dead at the top of their poles. . It went like this:. . The buildings tumbled in on themselves. Mothers clutching babies picked through the rubble. And pulled out their hair. . The skyline was beautiful on fire. All twisted metal stretching upwards. Everything washed in a thin orange haze. . I said: "kiss me<comma> you're beautiful -. These are truly the last days". . You grabbed my hand and we fell into it. Like a daydream or a fever. . We woke up one morning and fell a little further down -. For sure it's the valley of death. . I open up my wallet. And it's full of blood
A dreaded sunny day. So I meet you at the cemetry gates. Keats and Yeats are on your side. A dreaded sunny day. So I meet you at the cemetry gates. Keats and Yeats are on your side. While Wilde is on mine. So we go inside and we gravely read the stones. All those people<comma> all those lives. Where are they now?. With loves and hates. And passions just like mine. They were born. And then they lived. And then they died. Seems so unfair. I want to cry. You say: "Ere thrice the sun hath done. salutation to the dawn". And you claim these words as your own. But I've read well and I've heard them said. A hundred times (maybe less<comma> maybe more). If you must write prose or poems. The words you use should be your own. Don't plagiarise or take 'on loan'. There's always someone<comma> somewhere. With a big nose who knows. And who trips you up and laughs. When you fall. Who'll trip you up and laugh. When you fall. You say: "Ere long done do does did". Words which could only be your own. And then produce the text. From whence was ripped. 'Some dizzy whore'<comma> 1804. A dreaded sunny day. So let's go where we're happy. And I meet you at the cemetry gates. Oh Keats and Yeats are on your side. A dreaded sunny day. So let's go where we're wanted. And I meet you at the cemetry gates.

My mother was a Chinese trapeze artist in pre-war Paris . Smuggling bombs for the underground. And she met my father at a fete in Aix-en-Provence. He was disguised as a Russian cadet in the employ of the Axis.  . And there in the half-light of the provincial midnight . To a lone concertina they drank in cantinas . And toasted to Edith Piaf and the fall of the Reich. . My sister was born in a hovel in Burgundy . And left for the cattle but later was found by a communist. Who had deserted his ranks to follow his dream . To start up a punk rock band in South Carolina. . And I get letters sometimes<comma> they bought a plantation . She weeds the tobacco<comma> he offends the nation . And they write<comma> "Don't be a stranger<comma> y'hear? . Sincerely<comma> your sister.". . So my parents had me to the disgust of the prostitutes . On a bed in a brothel<comma> surprisingly raised with tender care . Til the money got tight and they bet me away . To a blind brigadier in a game of high stakes canasta. . But he made me a sailor on his brigadier ship fleet. I know every yardarm from main mast to jib sheet. But sometimes I long to be landlocked . And to work in a bakery
I never meant to go. I never meant to fall but I'm only gone. I never meant to go I'm only gone inside my own. Some day I'll wake you. Some times I'll wait for myself. Some day I'll hold you through. Tonight I'm alone to go high. Tonight I'm alone to go high. Tonight I'm alone to go. In state of confusion you made an illusion. State of confusion you made an illusion. It is exciting to be away. Feeling you all inside of me. I'm standing here but I'm really gone. You see me as I go. You've been precious to me. I've been blessed in the way. But Now I'm falling I'm inside
Soft from your lips to the rise of your stomach. Your lungs filled with fingers keep jamming words down my throat. Nothing to steal we've got nothing to love. Nothing to spill because oh we're so innocent oh. . Oh on the edge of. Oh on the edge of. . I could have built you a house on the ocean. The ocean repeating and receding into the sun. . So cut to you dead and now cut to the laughing. Cut through our bodies and lastly into our oh. . Oh on the edge of. Oh. Oh on the edge of
Going outside. Shoveling snow in the driveway<comma> driveway. Taking our shoes. Riding a sled down the hillside<comma> hillside. Can you say what you want?. Can you say what you want to be?. Can you be what you want?. Can you be what you want?. . Our father yells. Throwing gifts in the wood stove<comma> wood stove. My sister runs away. Taking her books to the schoolyard<comma> schoolyard. In time the snow will rise. In time the snow will rise. In time the Lord will rise. In time the Lord will rise. . Silent night. Holy night. Silent night. Nothing feels right

So I said<comma> man pull her out of the water. And then<comma> lay on hands and bind back her flippers and tail. Until international waters. And there we'll feel. All that's human inside of her. . So she's chilly and slick. On her hips where the scales meet with skin. With a sickening flick of her tail. Circling her gills filled with cold salty water. And she thrashes and twirls. Her freezing fins fluttering. . But she's pretty I think. With her hair dark as ink. And her belly bone-white. And her lips of a slight seashell pink. Lightly part as she's tonguing the tub's rusty rim. As the salt water it flows out again. . Oh<comma> farewell is to the land we know well. We'll never be touching again. To fields where we rambled and ran. Farewell to our wives and children. Let's stand on the deck and let's watch. Them all disappearing. . And the days all float by. And the days over waves under sky. And the weeks slowly leak into years. The last islands are all left behind. As we silently sail. Until late some dark night a wild wind starts to wail. And our map blows away. And our compasses fail. And it's out on the lost boiling black water where. I see her float out. She's so thin and so pale. I see her rise up. She's so fast and so fair. My hands meet and they press to a point in the air. But my mouth fills with more panic than prayer. And my skull fills with more colour than care. And my heart fills with love<comma> with too much love to bear. And I know that I'll stay<comma> that she'll always be there. My hands suck in cold<comma> sad seaweed strung through her hair

Cigarettes and carrot juice. Get yourself a new tattoo. For those sleeveless days of June. I'm sitting on the Cafe Xeno's steps. With a book I haven't started yet. Watching all the girls walk by. . Could I take you out. I'd be yours without a doubt. On that big dipper. And if the sound of this it frightens you. We could play it real cool. And act somewhat indifferent. . And hey June. Why'd you have to come. Why'd you have to come around so soon. I wasn't ready for all this nature. The terrible green<comma> green grass. The violent blooms of flower dresses. And afternoons that make me sleepy. . But we could wait awhile. Before we push that dull turnstile. Into the passage. The thousands they have tread. And others sometimes fled. Before the turn came. .

Walk across the courtyard towards the library. I can hear the insects buzz and the leaves 'neath my feet. Ramble up the stairwell into the hall of books.

Is the sexiest librarian. Take off those glasses and let down your hair for me. Take off those glasses and let down your hair for me. . Simple little beauty<comma> heaven in your breath. Simplest of pleasures<comma> the world at its best

at night we crossed the border following a Black robe. to the edge of the reservation—to Cataldo Mission. where the saints and all the martyrs look down on dying converts. <i>what makes the water holy</i> she says <i>is that that it's the closest thing to rain</i>. . I stole the mule from Anthony—I helped Anne up upon it. and we rode to Coeur d'Alene—passed Harrison and Wallace. they were blasting out the tunnels—making way for the light of learning. <i>when Jesus comes a'calling</i> she said <i>he's coming round the mountain on a train</i>. . Yeah. It's my home—last night I dreamt that I grew wings. I found a place where they could hear me when I sing. . we floated on to Hanford in a lumber boat up river. past the fisheries and the mill towns like a stretch of future graveyards. she was driven to distraction—said <i>I wonder what will happen. when they find out they're mistaken—the land is too changed to ever change</i>. . we waded through the marketplace—someone's ship had come in. there was silver and begonias—dynamite and cattle. there were hearts as big as apples and apples in the shape of Mary's heart. I said <i>inside this gilded cage a songbird always looks so plain</i>. . Yeah. It's my home—last night I dreamt that I grew wings. I found a place where they could hear me when I sing.. . and so they came with cameras—breaking through the morning mist. press and businessmen—tycoons—Episcopal philanthropists. lost in their appraisal of the body of a woman. but all we saw were lowlands—clouds clung to mountains without strings. . and at last we saw some people... . at last we saw some people.... at last we saw some people huddled up against. the rain that was descending like railroad spikes and hammers. they were headed for the border—walking and then running. and then they were gone into the fog but Anne said underneath their jackets she saw wings
You won't find it by your self. You're gonna need some help. And you won't fail with me around. Come on let's go. . I will tell you if you change. And who's been saying things. It's hard to tell who is real in here. Come on let's go. . You know who to turn to. Now everything's changed. Come on lets go. Stop looking for answers. In everyone's face. Come on let's go. . What's the point in wasting time. On people that you'll never know. Come on let's go. . When you're looking for a friend. But it's empty at the end. When everybody's disappeared. You won't be alone. . If you want I'll compensate. If you over estimate. So there's nothing left to fear. You won't be alone. You know who to turn to. Now everything's changed. Come on let's go. Stop looking for answers. In everyone's face. Come on let's go. . What's the point in wasting time. On people that you'll never know. Come on let's go

You may tire of me as our December sun is setting. 'Cause I'm not who I used to be . No longer easy on the eyes. But these wrinkles masterfully disguise . The youthful boy below. Who turned your way and saw . Something he was not looking for. Both a beginning and an end . But now he lives inside someone he does not recognize . When he catches his reflection on accident . . On the back of a motor bike . With your arms outstretched trying to take flight . Leaving everything behind . But even at our swiftest speed. We couldn't break from the concrete . In the city where we still reside. . And I have learned that even landlocked lovers yearn. For the sea like navy men . 'Cause now we say goodnight. From our own separate sides . Like brothers on a hotel bed . Like brothers on a hotel bed . Like brothers on a hotel bed . Like brothers on a hotel bed. . You may tire of me as our December sun is setting. 'Cause I'm not who I used to be
I want to hold the hand inside you. I want to take a breath that's true. I look to you and I see nothing. I look to you to see the truth. You live your life. You go in shadows.

I think it's strange you never knew. . A stranger's light comes on slowly. A stranger's heart without a home. You put your hands into your head. And then smiles cover your heart. . Fade into you. Strange you never knew. Fade into you. I think it's strange you never knew. . Fade into you. Strange you never knew. Fade into you. I think it's strange you never knew.

She looks just like an angel. When she walks across the room. She shines tonight. Her golden light. Is everything I need. . Lovers all around her. She wears them like her jewels.

I see you there. Your long black hair. Your eyes just stare. Your mind is turning . . You know I'll laugh. I won't take it back. I've seen your eyes. I know what you're thinking. . And one by one. We'll shoot our guns. We'll have fun. Don't ever doubt it. . And when I say. "Fare thee well<comma>. My only friend". Oh how the days go. Oh how the days go. . Your setting sun. Your broken drum. Your little drugs. I'll never forget you. I'll never forget you

Let me shout its common cause for things to fall apart. For radicals to ruin all that's right. I don't mean to flout the laws of government or heart. I just don't wanna lose your eye. . Wait for the ocean-bottled news. Fly-bys and radio balloons. We will sing of lesser traits. and play them for the magistrate. In groups of four or eight or twelve. Until they say "we might as well". . Grocery stores and cannonballs. Line up on my list of things I'll remember when I'm old. Water towers and Mid-west plains still in the abyss. Left unseen 'til we're further up the road. . Wait for the static stat airwaves. Land-locked ocean-side parades. We will bring our new debates. And sing them for the magistrate. In groups of four or eight or twelve. Until they say "we might as well". Hey<comma> hey<comma> hey<comma> we might as well. . These days are not fast. Times will not last. So they say<comma> but I'm having trouble believin'. Try to settle soft in the canopy we've lost. As you dance and sway and kiss with Costa Ricans. . These days are not fast. Times will not last. So they say<comma> but I'm having trouble believin'. Try to settle soft in the canopy we've lost. You are getting all you can from my hurting<comma> from my hurting. . La la la la. La la la la la.

There comes a time. A time in everyone's life. When nothing seems to go your way. Where nothing seems to turn out right. . There may come a time. When you just can't seem to find your place. And for every door you open. It seems like you get two slammed in your face. . That's when you need someone. Someone that you can call. When all your faith is gone. And it feels like you can't go on. . Let it be me. Let it be me. If it's a friend you need. Let it be me. Let it be me. . When it feels like you're always comin' up last. Pockets full of nothin' ain't got no cash. No matter where you turn . You ain't got no place to stand. You reach out for something and they slap your hand. . I remember all too well. Just how it feels to be all alone. To feel like you'd give anything. For just a little place you can call your own. . That's when you need someone. Someone that you can call. When all your faith is gone. And it feels like you can't go on. . Let it be me. Let it be me. If it's a friend you need. Let it be me. Let it be me

Now I hear you're in love with some big city man. and together you're making your big city plans. and you hope he don't find out about who you are. that we used to catch fireflies in mason jars. and we used to go down to the county fair. and we listened to blue grass in summer air. and we danced all night as the rain came down. and you held my hand as we slept on the ground. and we wrote our names in the old oak wood. I guess some things don't work out like they should. . . Do you miss me?. Do you miss me?. Do you miss me?. Do you miss me?. Do you miss me? yeah.... Do you miss me?

All I can ever be to you is a darkness that we knew. And this regret I got accustomed to. Once it was so right when we were at our height. Waiting for you in the hotel at night. . I knew I hadn't met my match but every moment we could snatch. I don't know why I got so attached. It's my responsibility you don't owe nothing to me. But to walk away<comma> I have no capacity. . He walks away<comma> the sun goes down. He takes the day but I'm gone. And in your way in this blue shade. My tears dry on their own. . I don't understand<comma> why do I stress a man. When there's so many bigger things at hand. We could've never had it all<comma> we had to hit a wall. So this is inevitable withdrawal. . Even if I stop wanting you<comma> and perspective pushes true. I'll be some next man's other woman soon. I cannot play myself again<comma> I should just be my own best friend. Not fuck myself in the head with stupid men. . He walks away<comma> the sun goes down. He takes the day but I'm gone. And in your way in this blue shade. My tears dry on their own. . So we are history<comma> your shadow covers me. The sky above<comma> a blaze. . He walks away<comma> the sun goes down. He takes the day but I'm gone. And in your way in this blue shade. My tears dry on their own. . I wish I could say no regrets and no emotional debt. 'Cause as we kiss goodbye the sun sets. So we are history<comma> the shadow covers me. The sky above<comma> a blaze that only lovers see. . He walks away<comma> the sun goes down. He takes the day but I'm gone. And in your way in this blue shade. My tears dry on their own. .

The leading light of the age all wondered amongst. Themselves what I would do next. After all that I'd found in my travels around. The world was there anything else left?. "Gentlemen"<comma> I said<comma> "I've studied the maps". "And if what I'm thinking is right". "There's another new world at the top of the world". "For whoever can break through the ice". . I looked round the room in that way I once had. And I saw that they wanted belief. So I said "All I've got are my guts and my God". Then I paused<comma>"and the Annabelle Lee". Oh the Annabelle Lee<comma> I saw their eyes shine. The most beautiful ship in the sea. My Nina<comma> My Pinta<comma> My Santa Maria. My beautiful Annabelle Lee. . That spring we set sail as the crowd waved from shore. And on board the crew waved their hats. But I never had family just the Annabelle Lee. So I didn't have cause to look back. I just set the course north and I studied the charts. And toward dark I drifted toward sleep. And I dreamed of the fine deep harbor I'd find. Past the ice for my Annabelle Lee. . After that it got colder the world got quiet. It was never quite day or quite night. And the sea turned the color of sky turned the color. Of sea turned the color of ice. 'Til at last all around us was fastness. One vast glassy desert of arsenic white. And the waves that once lifted us. Sifted instead into drifts against Annabelle's sides. . The crew gathered closer at first for the comfort. But each morning would bring a new set. Of the tracks in the snow leading over the edge. Of the world 'til I was the only one left. After that it gets cloudy but it feels like I lay there. For days maybe for months. But Annabelle held me the two of us happy. Just to think back on all we had done. . We talked of the other worlds we'd discover. As she gave up her body to me. And as I chopped up her mainsail for timber. I told her of all that we still had to see. As the frost turned her moorings to nine-tail. And the wind lashed her sides in the cold. I burned her to keep me alive every night. In the lover's embrace of her hold. . I won't call it rescue what brought me here back to. The old world to drink and decline. And to pretend that the search for another new world. Was well-worth the burning of mine. But sometimes at night in my dreams comes the singing. Of some known tropical bird. And I smile in my sleep thinking Annabelle Lee. Has finally made it to another new world
Man<comma> you got a lot of jokes to tell. So you throw your baby's pennies down the well. Give a little more than you like. Pick apart the past<comma> you're not going back.

I close my eyes . Only for a moment and the moment's gone. All my dreams. Pass before my eyes<comma> a curiosity. Dust in the wind . All we are is dust in the wind . . Same old song . Just a drop of water in an endless sea . All we do . Crumbles to the ground<comma> though we refuse to see . Dust in the wind . All we are is dust in the wind. Oh. . Now<comma> don't hang on . Nothing lasts forever but the Earth and sky. It slips away . And all your money won't another minute buy . Dust in the wind . All we are is dust in the wind (All we are is dust in the wind). Dust in the wind (Everything is dust in the wind). Everything is dust in the wind. The wind
There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold. And she's buying a stairway to Heaven. When she gets there she knows. If the stores are all closed. With a word she can get what she came for. Ooo-oooh. And she's buying a stairway to Heaven. . There's a sign on the wall. But she wants to be sure. Cause you know sometimes words have. Two meanings. In a tree by the brook. There's a songbird who sings. Sometimes all of our thoughts are misleading. . Oooh makes me wonder. Oh-ooooh makes me wonder. . There's a feeling I get. When I look to the west. And my spirit is crying for leaving. In my thoughts I have seen. Rings of smoke through the trees. And the voices of those who stand looking. . And oooh makes me wonder. And oh-ooooh makes me wonder. . And it's whispered that soon. If we all call the tune. Then the piper will lead us to reason. And a new day will dawn. For those who stand long. And the forests will echo with laughter. . Yes it makes me wonder. And owowowow<comma> no. . If there's a bustle in your hedgerow. Don't be alarmed now. It's just a spring clean for the May-queen. Yes there are two paths you can go by. But in the long run. There's still time to change the road you're on. On and on. . Said ooooh makes me wonder. And oh-oh-oh-ooooh makes me wonder. . Your head is humming and it won't go. In case you don't know. The piper's calling you to join him. Dear lady can you hear the wind blow. And did you know. Your stairway lies on the whispering wind. Say!. Say!. . Mother<comma> Mary & Yozuf!. . And as we wind on down the road. Our shadows taller than our soul. There walks a lady we all know. Who shines white light and wants to know. How everything still turns to gold. And if you listen very hard. The news will come to you at last. When all are one and one is all. To be a rock and not to roll. . And she's buying a stairway to Heaven
Where have all my friends gone . They've all disappeared . Turned around maybe one day . You're all that was there . Stood by unbelieving . Stood by on my own . Always thought I was someone . Turned out I was wrong . . You brought me through . And you made me feel . . Chorus: . So Blue . Why don't you stay behind . So Blue . Why don't you stop and look at what's going down . . Lived by an old woman . She'd never sell me a lie . It's hard to sing with someone . Who won't sing with you . Give all of my mercy . Give all of my heart . Never thought that I'd miss you . That I'd miss you so much . . You brought me through . And you made me feel . . (Chorus) . . All my life (Stand by) . I've waited for (Stand by). Someone I (Waiting round) . Could show the door (Now<comma> that I'm blue) . But nothing seems to change (That I'm blue from now on). You've come back into my arms. . So Blue . Why don't you stay behind . So Blue . Why don't you. Why don't you stay behind. . So Blue . Why don't you. Why don't you stay behind. . So Blue . Why don't you stop and look at what's going down
And take a little walk when the worst is to come. When I saw you looking like I never thought. And say you're at a loss or forgot. That words can do more than harm. . The town is gonna talk<comma> but these people do not. See things through to the very minimal. But what's it gonna cost to be gone?. If we see you like I hoped we never would. . When eyes can't look at you any other way. Any other way<comma> any other way. When eyes can't look at you any other way. Any other way<comma> any other way. . So take it as a song or a lesson to learn. And sometime soon be better than you were. If you say you're gonna go<comma> then be careful. And watch how you treat every living soul. . My eyes can't look at you any other way. Any other way<comma> any other way. When eyes can't look at you any other way. Any other way<comma> any other way
See<comma> the clouds are creeping towards the sun. And I'm slipping away unseen by anyone. The light is turning gray; the day is done. . Water is so cold and heavy on my mind. I dreamed of walking with you but I fell behind. Looking for a road I could not find. . And now the ice is stirring and spring is near. There is no one calling but the sound is clear. And though I'm not yet gone<comma> I'm still not here
I've heard there was a secret chord. That David played and it pleased the Lord. But you don't really care for music<comma> do you?. . It goes like this the fourth the fifth. The minor fall the major lift. The baffled King composing Hallelujah. . Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. . Your faith was strong but you needed proof. You saw her bathing on the roof. Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew you. . She tied you to a kitchen chair. She broke your throne she cut your hair. And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah. . Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. . Maybe I've been here before. I know this room I have walked this floor. I used to live alone before I knew you. . I've seen your flag on the marble arch. Love is not a victory march. It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah. . Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. . There was a time you let me know. What's real and going on below. But now you never show it to me<comma> do you?. . And remember when I moved in you. The holy dark was moving too. And every breath we drew was Hallelujah. . Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. . Maybe there's a God above. And all I ever learned from love. Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you. . And it's not a cry you can hear at night. It's not somebody who's seen the light. It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah. . Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. . Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah

Two jumps in a week. I bet you think that's pretty clever. Don't you boy. Flying on your motorcycle. Watching all the ground beneath you drop. . You'd kill yourself for recognition. Kill yourself to never ever stop. You broke another mirror. You're turning into something you are not. . Don't leave me high. Don't leave me dry. Don't leave me high. Don't leave me dry. .

I saw Nick Drake . At the corner of time and motion. I caught his eye . And he caught mine. I said "You're tall.". He said "No taller than tomorrow's ocean.". I saw Nick Drake . And he was fine. . I saw Nick Drake. As we were carrying the ice together. I saw his face. Beneath the glass. The net was gone. And all the strawberries of English weather. I saw him pass. Right through this place. . I saw Nick Drake. The habits of a lifetime. Will lay you low. Into your grave. And when you're gone. You take the whole world with you. I saw Nick Drake. I saw him wave. . And we're in bloom

A small Jean Genie snuck off to the city. Strung out on lasers and slash back blazers and. Ate all your razors while pulling the waiters. Talking 'bout Monroe and walking on Snow White.

As someone sets light to the first fire of autumn. We settle down to cut ourselves apart. Cough and twitch from the news on your face. And some foreign candle burning in your eyes. . Held to the past<comma> too aware of the pending. Chill as the dawn breaks and finds us up for sale. Enter the fog<comma> another low road descending. Away from the cold lust<comma> your house<comma> and summertime. . Blind to the last cursed affair. Pistols and countless lies. A trail of white blood betrays. The reckless route your craft is running. . Feed 'til the sun turns into wood. Dousing an ancient torch. Loiter the whole day through. And lose yourself in lines dissecting love. . Your name on my cast and my notes on your stay. Offer me little but doting on a crime. We've turned every stone and for all our inventions. In matters of love lost<comma> we've no recourse at all. . Blind to the last cursed affair. Pistols and countless lies. A trail of white blood betrays. The reckless route your craft is running. . Feed 'til the sun turns into wood. Dousing an ancient torch. Loiter the whole day through. And lose yourself in lines dissecting love
As soon as I got on the horse I forgot about the math.. Forgot about the odds against an adolescent standing up to all of Owen's wrath.. The heat of prairie summer is impossible to take.. I grab the hem and lift the fabric over my sweet head.. I know what you're looking for and I'm never gonna give it to you.. I'm never gonna give it to you.. I'm never gonna give it to you.. . Government rule established by a dazzling light show.. A hegemony armored with a thousand-watt head and seven inches of echo.. I keep up my velocity my spurs are in her sides.. I don't know what I'm doing and it is the only way.. Toward the range I'll ride<comma> singing<comma> I'm never gonna give it to you.. I'm never gonna give it to you.. I'm never gonna give it to you.. . "I am overrated" said the sculptress to the sea.. "I've been praised for all the ways the marble leaves the man<comma>. And I was wrong to try and free him". And as for me I am a vector I am muscle I am bone.. The sun upon my shoulders and the horse between my legs<comma>. This is all I know.. . My senses are bedazzled by the parallax of the road.. I concentrate to keep contained the overflow.. My knuckles grip so tightly my fingers start to bleed.. If what I have is what you need<comma>. I'm never gonna give it to you.. I'm never gonna give it to you.. I'm never gonna give it to you.
As the descent began I got the distinct impression. Lake Michigan had been frozen for decades. I conducted the warmth from my metronome sternum. To our massive jetting vessel billowing plumes of spent fuel. . The tundra under us cracked and ruptured. To reveal palisades. Made of blades of gray<comma> gray bristling grass. And papulose lichen. I was so frightened. As my grip on you tightened. Your skin got slicker. . I am a deserted bus depot. Though our approach suggested. An American hazy sea. Like the one I found inside. After driving you home once. Still half high. . I-90 through utter desolation. I sense evil at the heart of each far flung well lighted home. I close my eyes and see cellar stairways. Vermiculated with delicate animal bone. . Musty rooms house racks of fur jackets. Spattered with plasma. On a bus in Indiana. I called you and screamed. Under ceaseless patterns of weeping light
As the light hits you<comma>. As you shift along the floor<comma>. I find it hard to place my face.. How did I come to be here<comma> anyway?. It's terribly vague<comma> what's gone before.. . I could have been anyone.. You could have been anyone's dream.. . (dreamer). . Why did you have to choose our moment?. Why did you have to make me feel that?. Why did you make it so unreal?. . . Oh! To be in love<comma>. And never get out again.. Oh! To be in love<comma>. And never get out again.. Oh! To be in love<comma>. Never get out again.. . Oh! To be in love<comma>. And never get out again.. Oh! To be in love<comma>. And never get out again.. Oh! To be in love<comma>. Never get out again.. . . All the colours look brighter now.. Everything they say seems to sound new.. Slipping into tomorrow too quick<comma>. Yesterday always too good to forget.. Stop the swing of the pendulum. Let us through!. . . Oh! To be in love<comma>. And never get out again.. Oh! To be in love<comma>. And never get out again.. Oh! To be in love<comma>. Never get out again.
As the spring is made alive the winter dies. And the final cries of creatures are long behind. And full of spirit the village starts again. With one more year for a man to change his ways. . I used to feel all things around me stir. Grateful for all I received. Taking in the sounds and ways of creatures upon the earth. Great were the rivers I swam waiting out the sun. . As the winter dies the earth is brought to life. And a thousand merchant ships sail to find. A worthy village to land and start again. With one more year for a man to change his ways. . I used to feel all things around me stir. Grateful for all I received. Taking in the sounds and ways of creatures upon the earth. Great were the rivers I swam waiting out the sun. . I used to feel all things around me stir. I’d hear the sound of creatures upon the earth. Grateful for all I received. Though winter cold and spring

A strange form of life kicking through windows<comma> rolling on yards. Heading in loved ones<comma> triggering odds. A strange one. . And a hard way to come into a cabin<comma> into the weather. Into a path walking together. A hard one. . And the softest lips ever<comma> twenty-five years of waiting to kiss them. Smiling and waiting to bend down and kiss twice. The softest lips. . And a dark little room across the nation<comma> you found myself racing. Forgetting the strange and the hard and the soft kiss. In the dark room. . And a strange form of life kicking through windows<comma> rolling on yards. Heading in loved ones<comma> triggering odds. A strange one
As we fall into sequence. And we're eating our young. Remain silent and still for modesty. . When the splints have been broken. And they can't help you now. Do you pray with your eyes closed naturally. . Follow me to nowhere. Woven with the utmost care. . If I'm lost please don't find me. If I drown let me sink. We descended from no one. With a wink. . When it's cold outside hold me. Don't hold me. When I choose to rest my eyes coax me. Don't coax me. When it's cold outside hold me. Don't hold me. When I choose to rest my eyes coax me. Don't coax me. . Follow me to nowhere. Woven with the utmost care. . Have they cleansed you with chloride. And scrubbed behind the knees. Has your body been hollowed by the breeze

at night we crossed the border following a Black robe. to the edge of the reservation—to Cataldo Mission. where the saints and all the martyrs look down on dying converts. <i>what makes the water holy</i> she says <i>is that that it's the closest thing to rain</i>. . I stole the mule from Anthony—I helped Anne up upon it. and we rode to Coeur d'Alene—passed Harrison and Wallace. they were blasting out the tunnels—making way for the light of learning. <i>when Jesus comes a'calling</i> she said <i>he's coming round the mountain on a train</i>. . Yeah. It's my home—last night I dreamt that I grew wings. I found a place where they could hear me when I sing. . we floated on to Hanford in a lumber boat up river. past the fisheries and the mill towns like a stretch of future graveyards. she was driven to distraction—said <i>I wonder what will happen. when they find out they're mistaken—the land is too changed to ever change</i>. . we waded through the marketplace—someone's ship had come in. there was silver and begonias—dynamite and cattle. there were hearts as big as apples and apples in the shape of Mary's heart. I said <i>inside this gilded cage a songbird always looks so plain</i>. . Yeah. It's my home—last night I dreamt that I grew wings. I found a place where they could hear me when I sing.. . and so they came with cameras—breaking through the morning mist. press and businessmen—tycoons—Episcopal philanthropists. lost in their appraisal of the body of a woman. but all we saw were lowlands—clouds clung to mountains without strings. . and at last we saw some people... . at last we saw some people.... at last we saw some people huddled up against. the rain that was descending like railroad spikes and hammers. they were headed for the border—walking and then running. and then they were gone into the fog but Anne said underneath their jackets she saw wings

Baby canteen<comma> when i thought your heart stopped beating. The room brought out the silence in your breathing. A birth in wooded housing will help you live beyond the numbers. Let us pray to pan let in the light. And see us bathe and sleep among us. Smell the body of our elders. And wake up to the milky way at breakfast. I'll take the time to pick up all the widow makers broken . No real way to remember if we'll work again. . Color people say oh no<comma> cause they think it's contagious. Marshmallow people say oh yeah<comma> cause they think it's a masterpiece. . The sky has brakes . What a good day to rise. De Soto De Son will time. . Goodbye blue heron goodbye green fly goodbye goodbye. . I've got a raft you'll sail till the open lie in the lake. While your body is broken . When you go out I'll cry in the thicket. Shooting from school. There's a green where the crickets cry mom can't breathe and i know she's leaving. And that the birds of a quay are all good for the crocodile. So slow it down. Its not a race. Death takes time. Do you see it?. . Baby canteen swollen fingers in the water . I roped an Island pony for your birthday. I'll live in wooded housing till they put out all your needles. And drop you in and shelter near the highway

Fooled the black<comma> left us faded. King and chief probably had a big beef. Because of dat now I grit my teeth. So here's a song to the strong. 'Bout a shake of a snake. And the smile went along wit dat. Can't truss it. Kickin' wicked rhymes. Like a fortune teller. 'Cause the wickedness done by Jack. Where everybody at. Divided and sold. For liquor and the gold. Smacked in the back. For the other man to mack. Now the story that I'm kickin' is gory. Little Rock where they be. Dockin' this boat. No hope I'm shackled. Plus gang tackled. By the other hand swingin' the rope. Wearin' red<comma> white and blue Jack and his crew. The guy's authorized beat down for the brown. Man to the man<comma> each one so it teach one. Born to terrorize sisters and every brother. One love who said it. I know Whodini sang it. But the hater taught hate. That's why we gang bang it. Beware of the hand. When it's comin' from the left. I ain't trippin' just watch ya step. Can't truss it. An I judge everyone<comma> one by the one. Look here come the judge. Watch it here he come now. I can only guess what's happ'nin'.

When I roll over<comma> I roll over in somebody else's. 90 F--kin' days on a slave ship. Count 'em fallin' off 2<comma> 3<comma> 4 hun'ed at a time. Blood in the wood and it's mine. I'm chokin' on spit feelin' pain. Like my brain bein' chained. Still gotta give it what I got. But it's hot in the day<comma> cold in the night. But I thrive to survive<comma> I pray to god to stay alive. Attitude boils up inside. And that ain't it (think I'll every quit). Still I pray to get my hands 'round. The neck of the man wit' the whip. 3 months pass<comma> they brand a label on my ass. To signify. Owned. I'm on the microphone. Sayin' 1555. How I'm livin'. We been livin' here. Livin' ain't the word. I been givin'. Haven't got. Classify us in the have-nots. Fightin' haves. 'Cause it's all about money. When it comes to Armageddon. Mean I'm getting mine. Here I am turn it over Sam. 427 to the year. Do you understand. That's why it's hard. For the black to love the land. Once again. Bass in your face. Not an eight track. Gettin' it good to the wood.

Blue textures cascade downward to the base of the monolith. Like brush strokes on a canvas of souls. Two arms reach out a cloak of silent nihil. Revenants untouched by the scythe. They are lost in the dark woods of time. . Aloft in the landscape that you hail. I am the fog that seeps over here in the early hours. . Standing proud in the hollow of the land. A vestige of deeper purity etched in spirit agaisnt the sky. . The menhir had runes carved in limbs of oaken sovereignty. and could see the ages growing from within the palms. I can feel the era slipping into oblivion<comma>. no longer grasping the textures. I am slowly becoming stone. . As wolves celebrate the dusk<comma>. an old voice of wisdom haunts the vale. . Shapes flicker in the fire light through the windows. The woodlands burn with grace. Their silence drowns the age. . As wandering ghosts pass through the flames. A new age of rebirth lights the dawn. . But who are they who pass by the window?. The shapes; like black solar wheels scorched in the snow. by gods of the stone.... This elder stone shall never fall!. . Cast the aeons into the void. So that no other can seek them. No age<comma> no hands shall taint them. Pour the sorrows into the sun. They are lost forever in dark woods of time. Carve the symbols into the stone. So that another can find them. No age<comma> no hands shall change them. Pour the ages into the sun. They are lost forever in the dark woods of time

Esta è la storia verdadera de sombrero. caballero della pampa. amigo del pueblo amigo de dios. andale manito ermano con coraje e corazon. nacque già sopra un cavallo. aveva un fucile e un mantello nero. lo chiamarono Pedro Felippe. però per la gente è solo Sombrero. teneva timore de Dios. e il pelo cortato e il cuore caliente. viveva sempre da solo. col suo sombrero ma amava la gente. e sparava correva rideva giocava. cantava una canzone. una storia di sangue una storia d'amore. quando sparava era fermo. la mano sicura puntava al cuore. rubava ma solo per dare. la roba del ricco al povero nero. nessuno l'ha mai incontrato. ma ogni peone ama solo Sombrero. e sparava correva giocava barava. forse cercava un amigo. una birra un mantello o chissà che altra cosa. si seppe molto più tardi. Sombrero cantava e cercava una sposa. sembra che erano in dieci. quel giorno a seguire nella pampa Sombrero. un colpo di fuoco nel cuore. spezzò la vita del caballero. che amava soffriva rideva moriva. nessuno l'ha visto morire. per questo la gente sa che non è vero. negli occhi di chi ha sofferto. c'è una speranza un amico Sombrero. e cantando le sue canzoni. le storie di sangue le storie d'amore. anche se lui non c'è più. ha lasciato al paese un po' del suo cuore.
