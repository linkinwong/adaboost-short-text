She's got spit in her napkin. And she's pushing him that way. Like a stench to the men's room. . And it's making you nauseous. Where the hell have I got to?. There's a boy who's a Krishna. And he thinks you look pretty. Well<comma> he's eyeing your stockings. He's got books to help you with your life. . But there's no need to worry. This is just a vacation. It's not permanent leaving. Every kid gets excited. When his parents are yelling. Cause they ordered a Lincoln. And they received a compact. And there's fat nuns and tenors. Who are blocking departure. . Till I'm birthed from their vulvas. And I kiss you and hug you. Do you remember our forfeits?. And you shout at the platform. . Here we come mister airplane (4x). .

As soon as I got on the horse I forgot about the math.. Forgot about the odds against an adolescent standing up to all of Owen's wrath.. The heat of prairie summer is impossible to take..

I was so frightened. As my grip on you tightened. Your skin got slicker. . I am a deserted bus depot. Though our approach suggested. An American hazy sea. Like the one I found inside. After driving you home once. Still half high. . I-90 through utter desolation. I sense evil at the heart of each far flung well lighted home. I close my eyes and see cellar stairways. Vermiculated with delicate animal bone. . Musty rooms house racks of fur jackets. Spattered with plasma. On a bus in Indiana. I called you and screamed. Under ceaseless patterns of weeping light,notsad

Baby canteen<comma> when i thought your heart stopped beating. The room brought out the silence in your breathing. A birth in wooded housing will help you live beyond the numbers. Let us pray to pan let in the light. And see us bathe and sleep among us. Smell the body of our elders. And wake up to the milky way at breakfast. I'll take the time to pick up all the widow makers broken . No real way to remember if we'll work again. . Color people say oh no<comma> cause they think it's contagious. Marshmallow people say oh yeah<comma> cause they think it's a masterpiece. . The sky has brakes . What a good day to rise. De Soto De Son will time. . Goodbye blue heron goodbye green fly goodbye goodbye. . I've got a raft you'll sail till the open lie in the lake. While your body is broken . When you go out I'll cry in the thicket. Shooting from school. There's a green where the crickets cry mom can't breathe and i know she's leaving. And that the birds of a quay are all good for the crocodile. So slow it down. Its not a race. Death takes time. Do you see it?. . Baby canteen swollen fingers in the water . I roped an Island pony for your birthday. I'll live in wooded housing till they put out all your needles. And drop you in and shelter near the highway,notsad

(Chorus x15). Make you feel that way. . (Verse One). Up an early for the hope of a brand new day. See a homie you ain't seen since back in the day. Fresh haircut fitted wit a fat ass fade. End of work<comma> we chilling on a Saturday. How you felt when you first heard the data came. Rakim KRS hey I had that tape. Cooling out with ol girl on a fat ass date. Find a hundred dollar bill wow man that's great. Get promoted at your job up to management. Plot a long time finally a plan has made it. Time I feel I wanna shout<comma> man its real that way. Wanna think of things that make you feel that way. . (Chorus x15). . (Verse Two). Christmas day when your mamma got your first bike. Type of feeling when you went and when your first fight.

Deaf man get his hearing now in come vibes. Blind man get sight see his first sunrise . Dumb man speaking out<comma> now he's load and clear. Earth through your chout smile so proud ya wear. Going in your third eye for the styles ya hear. Making music that'll bump for a thousand years. Eating right feeling conscience like health is first. Said a prayer that's sincere and you felt it work. Times I feel I wanna shout<comma> man it's real that way. When I'm thinking things that make you feel that way. . (Chorus x15). . (Verse Three).

In the dark it's more likely that you notice light. In the light more likely that you notice night. Hungry more appreciation for that meal. Dead broke more appreciation for that grill. A bad day'll make you really notice ones that's good. And that'll make things a little better understood. Times I feel I wanna shout<comma> man it's real that way. When I think of things that make you feel that way. Make you feel that way.... . (Ya know its like ahh like the most greatest feeling you could ever feel. you like just total illation. Sunny day<comma> just that day.. You know its just like you know just the most joyous feeling. you could ever comprehend. You know<comma> chilling with your family..

Sombrero cantava e cercava una sposa. sembra che erano in dieci. quel giorno a seguire nella pampa Sombrero. un colpo di fuoco nel cuore. spezzò la vita del caballero. che amava soffriva rideva moriva. nessuno l'ha visto morire. per questo la gente sa che non è vero. negli occhi di chi ha sofferto. c'è una speranza un amico Sombrero. e cantando le sue canzoni. le storie di sangue le storie d'amore. anche se lui non c'è più. ha lasciato al paese un po' del suo cuore.,notsad
