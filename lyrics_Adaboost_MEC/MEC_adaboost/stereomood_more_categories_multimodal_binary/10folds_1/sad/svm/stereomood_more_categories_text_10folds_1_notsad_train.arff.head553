'Any other pales, she was the best type of jail. The rarest gem to find, yet she was the worst of her kind. There\'s nowhere to hide, memories are there until you die.

A farce on parade, with the look of a liar, it\'s a powerful thing that she preached. A promise not made, with feet to the fire, it\'s a thing that she held out of reach. I\'m caught up in her mane. To quit or carry on is the same. A with like a scar remains. Any other pales, she was the best type of jail. The rarest gem to find, yet she was the worst of her kind.
