Your heart's on the loose. You rolled them sevens with nothing to lose. This ain't no place for the weary kind. . You called all your shots. Shooting eight ball at the corner truck stop. Somehow this don't feel like home anymore. . And this ain't no place for the weary kind. And this ain't no place to lose your mind. This ain't no place to fall behind. Pick up your crazy heart and give it one more try. . Your body aches. Playing your guitar<comma> sweating out the hate. The days and the nights all feel the same. . Whiskey has been a thorn in your side. It doesn't forget. The highway that calls for your heart inside. . And this ain't no place for the weary kind. This ain't no place to lose your mind. This ain't no place to fall behind. Pick up your crazy heart and give it one more try. . Your lover's warm kiss. Is too damn far from your fingertips. You are the man that ruined her world. . Your heart's on the loose. You rolled them sevens with nothing to lose.

I felt them like a flame. Candle in my cold bones. . Tonight you were my muse. As I belted and I strummed. Trying not to drown. In the helicopter drone. . Alesund. . From the crowd I heard.

Ninety Miles An Hour. Words by H Blair & D. Robertson. Sung by Bob Dylan. . . I took you home from a party and we kissed in fun . A few stolen kisses and no harm was done . Instead of stopping when we could we went right on . Till suddenly we found that the brakes were gone. . . You belong to someone else<comma> and I do too . It's just crazy bein' here with you. As a bad motorcycle with the devil in the seat . Going ninety miles an hour down a dead end street. Ninety miles an hour down a dead end street. . . I didn't want to want you<comma> but now I have no choice . It's too late to listen to that warning voice . All I hear is thunder of two hearts beat . Going ninety miles an hour down a dead end street . Ninety miles an hour down a dead end street. . . You're not free to belong to me. And you know I could never be your own. Your lips on mine are like a sweet<comma> sweet wine . But we're heading for a wall of stone.. . Warning signs are flashing ev'ry where<comma> but we pay no heed .

Did I burn each last bit of myself. Did I turn my back on the kid in myself. And tear the oldest root. In a charlatan's pursuit. And the world difting farther away. . On the run with nowhere to hide.

By the time that you read this I will have repented. I know I am a fool. For trying to play it cruel. And you played so much kinder than I. . Your memory now is the shadow to my shadow. I wind it tight like a player piano. Your skirt above your knees. I watch you press the keys. It calms the smarting flesh. Of the wound we have undressed. . If still there's a song deep in this marrow. Who lets you draw that last shivering arrow. What kind of smarting loon. Believes that he can shoot the moon. Calm these frailing nerves.

God bless the daylight. The sugary smell of springtime. Remembering when you were mine . In a still suburban town. . When every Thursday. I'd brave those mountain passes. And you'd skip your early classes . And we'd learn how our bodies worked. . God damn the black night. With all its foul temptations. I've become what I always hated. When I was with you then. . We looked like giants. In the back of my gray subcompact. Fumbling to make contact. As the others slept inside. . And together there in a shroud of frost. The mountain air began to pass . Through every pane of weathered glass. And I held you closer than anyone would ever guess. . Do you remember the J.A.M.C.. And reading aloud from magazines?. I don't know about you<comma> but I swear on my name they could smell it on me. I've never been too good with secrets<comma> no. . And together there in a shroud of frost. The mountain air began to pass . Through every pane of weathered glass. And I held you closer,0.098806,0.053396,0.147536,2.816442,0.114678,0.000363,1.447351,3.487499,0.398326,0.161152,0.644809,0.019637,0.077607,0.659556,0.000186,0.206312,0.187256,0.191033,0.169083,0.164098,0.147686,0.14943,0.021235,0.28028,0.237146,0.16729,0.24144,0.217396,0.094127,0.101039,0.098273,0.083321,0.047544,0.035165,0.02216,0.045011,0.077897,0.148592,0.26185,0.005305,0.406738,0.127005,0.028858,0.025736,0.052313,0.204241,14307.251984,32.784843,33.321286,0.001584,0.555103,0.314758,83.87672,5.828185,1.507336,0.585766,0.997727,0.901907,0.158312,112.6777,5.193165,61.73983,0.449313,0.010492,0.007998,0.056489,0.000067,0.014229,9720.354,0.191025,0,0.858189,0.105915,0,0.121782,0.004275,555.0942,56306.24,0.033354,0.038388,0.000075,-11.32401,-12.5184,1.167034,-0.862499,-2.96568,-2.433544,3.393095,0.000307,-0.510068,-2.960918,0.092881,0.102236,0.034115,4.706759,0.136733,1.978395,0.000001,0.001699,0.608188,8.170981,10.80706,0.329668,6.346372,2.511482,0.308983,2.753703,2371,-0.041728,4.052941,0.790431,-4.300435,8.252186,0.998586,0.830322,-0.000001,0.78809,0.003197,0.000057,-0.127866,0.000467,-0.484984,2598,31.53818,sad

Seems like I relied too hard on a dream. Now tell me girl where have you really been. Cause I've only got this life right here. Wasted all and contain all the fear.

Well I've been there now once or twice. Now tell me girl did you think that was very nice. And I would say it was just one moment. But it was gone just as fast as it came. So I drowned myself in a tall glass of whatever. Does it matter to you?. And the tears would come with the cold cold rain. And I know for sure that I succumb to the pain.

You never hear me talk about one day getting out. Why put a new address on the same old loneliness. Everybody knows where that is. We built that house of his. And when he's not home. Someone else you know always is. If Heaven's really coming back. I hope it has a heart attack. When they see how dangerous it is for guys like that. The night has always known when it's time to get going. When it's really been so long that it starts showing. It's always had that ghost who always almost. Tells me the Secret. How there's really no difference in who he was once. And who he's become. Everything you hated me for… Honey there was so much more. I just didn't get busted.. But I'm not looking for an easy way out. This whole life it's been about. Try and try and try. And try and try and try.

Anda my love. Wake up to your window . The day calls in billows . It's echoing moonlight onto the blue nightmare of your heart. In cosy red rainbow . It's shaking off halos . And the memory of our sacred so and so's. . Oh<comma> take my hand sweet . Complete your release. Unbury your feet . And married we'll be. Alone in receiving ours is a feeling. Not that they would see. They don't know that we could be . Down where your cradle escaped the sea . And your raven-haired mama caught told you so's. . We're laying in the shadow of your family tree . Your haunted heart and me. Brought down by an old idea whose time has come . And in the shadow of the gallows of your family tree . There's a hundred hearts or three. Pumping blood to the roots of evil to keep them young . . Ah me all mine. Is it safe to say that we've waited patiently . Call me on time . And recall the tune that has placed us gracefully . All into line . There's a garden grave and a place there saved for you . I fall by your side . Though your silver-haired mama throws told-you so's . . We're laying in the shadow of your family tree. Your haunted heart and me. Brought down by an old idea whose time has come. And in the shadow of the gallows of your family tree. There's a hundred hearts or three. Pumping blood to the roots of evil to keep them young. . Now we're gathered in the shadow of your family tree. In halted harmony. Brought down by an old idea whose time has come . And in the shadow of the valley of your family tree. There's a hundred hearts or three.

I hear the tiniest sparks and the tenderest sounds. Diving music. Drowning the sound. Waltzing with the hairs upon my arms. Then your fight or flight alarm. And you tremble . Then you stumble. And you scrape up your palms. . I can't stay here to hold your hand. I've been away for so long. I've lost my taste for home. And that's a dirty<comma> fallow feeling.... To be the dangling ceiling. From when the roof came crashing down. . Peeling in the heat. Vanish in the rain. The next time you say "forever". I will punch you in your face. Just because you don't believe it. Doesn't mean I didn't mean it. You never knew when I'll show you the never.

I've heard there was a secret chord. That David played and it pleased the Lord. But you don't really care for music<comma> do you?. It goes like this: the fourth<comma> the fifth. The minor fall<comma> the major lift. The baffled king composing Hallelujah. . Hallelujah<comma> Hallelujah. Hallelujah<comma> Hallelujah. . Your faith was strong<comma> but you needed proof.

He opens his eyes falls in love at first sight. With the girl in the doorway. What beautiful lines and how full of life. After thousands of years what a face to wake up to. He holds back a sigh as she touches his arm. She dusts off the bed where 'til now he's been sleeping. And under miles of stone<comma> the dried fig of his heart. Under scarab and bone starts back to its beating. . She carries him home in a beautiful boat. He watches the sea from a porthole in stowage. He can hear all she says as she sits by his bed. And one day his lips answer her in her own language. The days quickly pass he loves making her laugh. The first time he moves it's her hair that he touches. She asks<comma> “Are you cursed?” He says<comma> “I think that I'm cured”. Then he talks of the Nile and the girls in bulrushes. . In New York he is laid in a glass covered case. He pretends he is dead people crowd round to see him. But each night she comes round and the two wander down. The halls of the tomb that she calls a museum. Often he stops to rest but then less and less. Then it's her that looks tired staying up asking questions. He learns how to read from the papers that she. Is writing about him and he makes corrections. . It's his face on her book more and more come to look. Families from Iowa<comma> upper west siders. Then one day it's too much he decides to get up. And as chaos ensues he walks outside to find her. She's using a cane and her face looks too pale. But she's happy to see him as they walk he supports her. She asks<comma> “Are you cursed?” but his answer's obscured. In a sandstorm of flashbulbs and rowdy reporters. . Such reanimation the two tour the nation. He gets out of limos he meets other women. He speaks of her fondly their nights in the museum. But she's just one more rag now he's dragging behind him. She stops going out she just lies there in bed. In hotels in whatever towns they are speaking. Then her face starts to set and her hands start to fold. And one day the dried fig of her heart stops its beating. . Long ago on the ship she asked<comma> “Why pyramids?”. He said<comma> “Think of them as an immense invitation”. She asked<comma> “Are you cursed?” He said<comma> “I think that I'm cured”.

With intensity a drop evaporates by law. In conclusion leaving is easy. When you've got some place you need to be. I'm giving up this gig for another season. . With the TV on mute. I'm listening back to the tapes. On the hotel bed. My my my apocalypse. . I realized I had said very little about waves or wheels. Or riding for the feeling. Riding for the feeling. Is the fastest way to reach the shore. On water or land. Riding for the feeling. . What if I had stood there at the end and said again and again. An answer to every question. Riding for the feeling. Would that have been a suitable goodbye?,0.030103,0.021327,0.030002,6.092091,-0.445509,0.000117,1.562346,4.62854,0.307443,0.082708,0.579444,0.007564,0.026429,0.711554,0.00009,0.203365,0.17919,0.178277,0.171707,0.155572,0.156388,0.148608,0.015293,0.334193,0.285507,0.391389,0.324878,0.307456,0.121645,0.1448,0.154551,0.12078,0.075385,0.066781,0.017946,0.047272,0.069849,0.141424,0.262701,0.011949,0.512501,0.136937,0.046034,0.037834,0.052016,0.20437,4877.484424,13.563088,12.270439,0.001525,0.534143,0.323544,63.73921,3.792412,1.168486,1.114697,0.973916,0.879848,0.097102,137.1753,7.19961,505.6792,1.054294,0.024822,0.341784,0.526006,0.000286,0.004512,9796.917,3.133801,0,0.930093,0.117119,0,0.065063,0.002877,247.3624,35755.62,0.006295,0.003625,0.000029,-2.42065,-3.607169,-0.756109,-0.408042,-1.46291,-3.846678,-3.958268,0.001984,-5.361135,-8.397336,0.030629,0.025473,0.027096,59.58348,0.15933,0.202131,0.000001,0.00092,1.617495,20.43925,7.981046,0.482807,7.865238,2.891422,0.431856,4.228572,2023,-0.086561,4.766426,0.946912,-3.177305,7.18427,0.821925,0.973954,0.000001,0.690723,0.004144,0.000038,-0.116062,0.000534,-0.090485,2244,8.545238,sad

Good plans are made by hand. I'd cut a clearing in the land. For a little bed. For her to cry comfortable in. . And each day I looked out on the land. And I wondered what all was gone. Until I saw it was lucky old me. How could I run without losing anything?. How could I run without becoming lean?. It was agreed. It was a greed. It was me tearing out the baby's breath. . Oh I am a helpless man. So help me!. I'm on my knees. Gardening. Trying to make the baby's breath blow. . It was not a weed it was a flower. My baby's gone. Oh where has my baby gone?.

Hope you're keeping some kind of record. . Yes and Jane came by with a lock of your hair. She said that you gave it to her. That night that you planned to go clear. Did you ever go clear?. . Ah<comma> the last time we saw you you looked so much older. Your famous blue raincoat was torn at the shoulder. You'd been to the station to meet every train. But you came home alone without Lili Marlene. . And you treated my woman to a little flake of your life. And when she came home she was nobody's wife. . Well<comma> I see you there with the rose in your teeth. One more thin gypsy thief. Well<comma> I see Jane's awake. She sends her regards. . And what can I tell you<comma> my brother<comma> my killer?. What can I possibly say?. I guess I miss you<comma> I guess I forgive you. I'm glad you stood in my way. . If you ever come by here for Jane or for me. Your enemy is sleeping and a woman is free. Yes and thanks for the trouble you took from her eyes. I thought it was there for good so I never tried. . Ah<comma> yes and Jane came by with a lock of your hair. She said that you gave it to her. That night that you planned to go clear. .

Oh comely<comma> I will be with you when you lose your breath<comma>. Chasing the only meaningful memory you thought you had left.. With some pretty<comma> bright and bubbly terrible scene. That was doing her thing on your chest.. But oh comely<comma>. It isn't as pretty as you'd like to guess. In your memory<comma> you're drunk on your awe to me. It doesn't mean anything at all.. Oh comely<comma>. All of your friends are all letting you blow<comma>. Bristling and ugly<comma> bursting with fruits falling out from the holes. Of some pretty<comma> bright<comma> and bubbly friend. You could need to say comforting things in your ear. But oh comely<comma>. There isn't such one friend that you could find here.. Standing next to me<comma>. He's only my enemy. I'll crush him with everything I own.. Say what you want to say. Hang for your hollow ways. Moving your mouth to pull out. All your miracle aimed for me.. Your father made fetuses with flesh licking ladies<comma>. While you and your mother were asleep in the trailer park.. Thunderous sparks from the dark of the stadiums<comma>. The music and medicine you needed for comforting.. So make all your fat fleshy fingers to moving<comma>. And pluck all your silly strings<comma> bend all your notes for me.. Soft silly music is meaningful magical<comma>. The movements were beautiful<comma> all in your ovaries.. All of them milking with green fleshy flowers<comma>. While powerful pistons were sugary sweet machines.. Smelling of semen all under the garden. Was all you were needing when you still believed in me.. Say what your want to say.. Hang for your hollow ways.. Moving your mouth to pull out. All your miracle aimed for me.. And I know they buried her body with others<comma>. Her sister and mother and five-hundred families.. And will she remember me fifty years later?. I wished I could save her in some sort of time machine.. Know all your enemies.. We know who our enemies are.. Goldaline<comma> my dear<comma>. We will fold and freeze together. Far away from here.. There is sun and spring and green forever.. But now we move to feel for ourselves inside some stranger's stomach.. Place your body here<comma>.

And you found another way to tell the truth. I put no one else us above us. We'll still be best friends when all turns to dust. . We are so smooth now. Our edges are beaten driftwood whittled down. Old bodies slip when they make love. We'll mine our sparks to shoot above us,0.136085,0.105311,0.221515,3.785963,-0.196079,0.000274,1.483424,5.909322,0.413258,0.241776,0.619573,0.028233,0.072997,0.62523,0.000316,0.210376,0.190928,0.15759,0.12838,0.128955,0.12633,0.108317,0.025121,0.650062,0.36943,0.363621,0.222355,0.261941,0.097818,0.109267,0.097307,0.145252,0.071702,0.060374,0.048122,0.047903,0.082248,0.152013,0.257969,0.015723,0.432372,0.086456,0.034633,0.035596,0.047777,0.20467,14681.355024,61.104508,37.771534,0.001533,0.559239,0.324192,111.3198,6.888316,1.56648,0.514034,1.433559,0.887881,0.101589,50.40662,5.48372,503.6048,1.90735,0.014432,0.007429,0.650581,0.000452,0.00953,1799.12,0.390098,0,0.921438,0.131561,0,0.072438,0.004064,1145.916,143074.9,0.046016,0.0275,0.000229,-11.60301,-9.055779,0.436155,-0.537207,-1.672372,0.499817,-1.875401,-0.003685,8.115932,0.127616,0.13689,0.12305,0.04331,4.744878,0.140572,0.33911,0.000004,0.003533,0.920627,6.267697,4.179801,0.383099,3.296805,2.30217,0.481188,3.175909,2706,0.040101,3.765087,0.842228,-3.970833,7.342043,1.261619,0.890677,-0.000003,1.128307,-0.00411,0.000099,-0.147779,0.00099,-0.399042,65,6.041824,sad
When sadness fills your heart. And sorrow hides the longing to be free. When things go wrong each day. You fix your mind to âscape your misery . . Your troubled young life. Had made you turn. To a needle of death . . How strange<comma> your happy words. Have ceased to bring a smile from everyone. How tears have filled the eyes. Of friends that you once had walked among . . Your troubled young life. Had made you turn. To a needle of death . . One grain of pure white snow. Dissolved in blood spread quickly to your brain. In peace your mind withdraws. Your death so near your soul can't feel no pain . . Your troubled young life. Had made you turn. To a needle of death . . Your mother stands a'cryin'. While to the earth your body's slowly cast. Your father stands in silence. Caressing every young dream of the past . . Your troubled young life. Had made you turn. To a needle of death . . Through ages<comma> man's desires. To free his mind<comma> to release his very soul. Has proved to all who live. That death itself is freedom for evermore . . And your troubled young life. Will make you turn.

Where oh where have you been my love?. Where oh where can you be?. It's been so long since the moon has gone. And oh what a wreck you've made me. . Are you there over the ocean?. Are you there up in the sky?. Until the return of my love. This lullaby. . My hope is on the horizon. Every face<comma> it's your eyes I can see. I plead<comma> I pray through each night and day. Our embrace is only a dream. . And as sure as days come from moments. Each hour becomes a life's time.

Look what you've done to me. Look at my tears. Forget my heart. No reason to lie to me it can't get any worse. Every little thing that you do to me. Every single day that goes by.

The paranoid great movie queen. Sits idly fully armed. The powder and mascara there. A warning light for charm. We see her every movie night. The strong against the weak. The lines come out and struggle with. The empty voice that speaks. . Her heart is oh so tired now. Of kindnesses gone by. Like broken glasses in a drain. Gone down but not well spent. The road from Barbary to here. She sold then stole right back. The vanity<comma> insanity her hungry heart forgave. The fading bride's dull beauty grows. Just begging to be seen. Beneath the magic lights that reach from . Barbary to here. . Her schoolhouse mind has windows now. Where handsome creatures come to watch. The anaesthetic wearing off.

When I take the prisoners swimming. They have the time of their lives. I love to watch them floating. . On their backs. Unburden and relaxed. . I sit in the tall grass and look the other way. And when I hall them in they always sing. Our sentences will not served. . We are constantly on trial. It's a way to be free. . Most nights I go for a drive. To to the highest place I can find. Stand there on a cliff with goose flesh. Watching the wind rip the leaves of the trees. . Death defying. Every breath. Death defying. . Soon we all be back in the yard. Behind the wall.

Like desperados waitin' for a train . Like desperados waitin' for a train . . From the time that I could walk<comma> he'd take me with him . To a bar called the Green Frog Cafe .

Watch my wiper blades pound it like a drum. On the bridge out of Hammond (x2). Think about what's darkening my life (x2). See the light of the afterworld shining on the ruins. It's the light of nowhere else burning to the west. See its sulphery shine (x2). From the bridge out of Hammond (x2). See the big city moon (x3). Between the radio towers.

Oh the sisters of mercy. They are not departed or gone. They were waiting for me. When I thought that I just can't go on. And they brought me their comfort . And later they brought me this song. Oh I hope you run into them . You who've been traveling so long. . Yes you who must leave everything . That you cannot control. It begins with your family . But soon it comes round to your soul. Well<comma> I've been where you're hanging. I think I can see how you're pinned. When you're not feeling holy. Your loneliness says that you've sinned. . They lay down beside me. I made my confession to them. They touched both my eyes. And I touched the dew on their hem. If your life is a leaf. That the seasons tear off and condemn. They will bind you with love. That is graceful and green as a stem. . When I left they were sleeping. I hope you run into them soon. Don't turn on the lights. You can read their address by the moon. And you won't make me jealous. If I hear that they sweetened your night. We weren't lovers like that. And besides it would still be all right. . We weren't lovers like that.

He came dancing across the water. With his galleons and guns. Looking for the new world. And that palace in the sun.. . On the shore lay Montezuma. With his coca leaves and pearls. In his halls he often wandered. With the secrets of the worlds. . . And his subjects gathered 'round him. Like the leaves around a tree. In their clothes of many colors. For the angry gods to see.. . And the women all were beautiful. And the men stood straight and strong. They offered life in sacrifice. So that others could go on.. . Hate was just a legend. And war was never known. The people worked together. And they lifted many stones.. . And they carried them to the flatlands. But they died along the way. And they built up with their bare hands.

It's four in the morning<comma> the end of December. I'm writing you now just to see if you're better. New York is cold<comma> but I like where I'm living. There's music on Clinton Street all through the evening. . I hear that you're building your little house deep in the desert. You're living for nothing now. I hope you're keeping some kind of record. . Yes<comma> and Jane came by with a lock of your hair. She said that you gave it to her. That night that you planned to go clear. Did you ever go clear?. . Ah<comma> the last time we saw you<comma> you looked so much older. Your famous blue raincoat was torn at the shoulder. You'd been to the station to meet every train. And you came home without Lili Marlene. . And you treated my woman. To a flake of your life. And when she came back. She was nobody's wife. . Well<comma> I see you there with the rose in your teeth. One more thin gypsy thief. Well<comma> I see Jane's awake. She sends her regards. . And what can I tell you<comma> my brother<comma> my killer. What can I possibly say?. I guess that I miss you. I guess I forgive you. I'm glad you stood in my way. . If you ever come by here. For Jane or for me. Your enemy is sleeping. And his woman is free. . Yes<comma> and thanks. For the trouble you took from her eyes. I thought it was there for good so I never tried. . And Jane came by with a lock of your hair. She said that you gave it to her.

My mother was a Chinese trapeze artist in pre-war Paris . Smuggling bombs for the underground. And she met my father at a fete in Aix-en-Provence. He was disguised as a Russian cadet in the employ of the Axis.  . And there in the half-light of the provincial midnight . To a lone concertina they drank in cantinas . And toasted to Edith Piaf and the fall of the Reich. . My sister was born in a hovel in Burgundy . And left for the cattle but later was found by a communist. Who had deserted his ranks to follow his dream . To start up a punk rock band in South Carolina. . And I get letters sometimes<comma> they bought a plantation . She weeds the tobacco<comma> he offends the nation . And they write<comma> "Don't be a stranger<comma> y'hear? . Sincerely<comma> your sister.". . So my parents had me to the disgust of the prostitutes . On a bed in a brothel<comma> surprisingly raised with tender care . Til the money got tight and they bet me away . To a blind brigadier in a game of high stakes canasta. . But he made me a sailor on his brigadier ship fleet. I know every yardarm from main mast to jib sheet. But sometimes I long to be landlocked . And to work in a bakery,0.07293,0.047028,0.101739,4.578624,0.270399,0.000363,1.470057,4.618107,0.368677,0.153123,0.604863,0.02449,0.082897,0.870348,0.00039,0.207966,0.19598,0.197825,0.172784,0.158174,0.154589,0.150945,0.035933,0.355851,0.301136,0.281727,0.270926,0.280772,0.129542,0.100487,0.121667,0.127934,0.103739,0.040616,0.030389,0.041531,0.078834,0.144384,0.262141,0.011972,0.375025,0.102753,0.039675,0.030199,0.057952,0.205148,9993.769534,46.818968,28.006315,0.001487,0.533962,0.311304,73.64918,4.967485,1.400189,0.613288,0.775342,0.899896,0.134829,154.6041,5.492742,410.6736,0.936449,0.014672,0.048839,0.269277,0.000202,0.010273,14184.63,0.578442,0,0.908123,0.113096,0,0.083492,0.003715,522.2715,116846.8,0.02461,0.023627,0.000253,-7.958739,-7.700234,-0.520024,-0.086288,1.087032,-1.080303,-0.852612,0.000416,-3.342804,-2.846659,0.072733,0.071976,0.040636,8.716039,0.149005,0.659649,-0.000007,0.002348,1.145815,9.717449,6.71758,0.449593,6.11852,2.7837,0.356501,3.461016,670,0.088614,6.116501,0.640321,-3.551729,7.135619,0.728836,0.79603,0.000002,0.799237,-0.000811,0.000053,-0.168309,0.000893,-0.21641,2046,12.03065,sad

So I said<comma> man pull her out of the water. And then<comma> lay on hands and bind back her flippers and tail. Until international waters. And there we'll feel. All that's human inside of her. . So she's chilly and slick. On her hips where the scales meet with skin. With a sickening flick of her tail. Circling her gills filled with cold salty water. And she thrashes and twirls. Her freezing fins fluttering. . But she's pretty I think. With her hair dark as ink. And her belly bone-white. And her lips of a slight seashell pink. Lightly part as she's tonguing the tub's rusty rim. As the salt water it flows out again. . Oh<comma> farewell is to the land we know well. We'll never be touching again. To fields where we rambled and ran. Farewell to our wives and children. Let's stand on the deck and let's watch. Them all disappearing. . And the days all float by. And the days over waves under sky. And the weeks slowly leak into years. The last islands are all left behind. As we silently sail. Until late some dark night a wild wind starts to wail. And our map blows away. And our compasses fail. And it's out on the lost boiling black water where. I see her float out. She's so thin and so pale. I see her rise up. She's so fast and so fair. My hands meet and they press to a point in the air. But my mouth fills with more panic than prayer. And my skull fills with more colour than care. And my heart fills with love<comma> with too much love to bear. And I know that I'll stay<comma> that she'll always be there. My hands suck in cold<comma> sad seaweed strung through her hair,0.053433,0.038118,0.085713,5.731427,0.021035,0.000083,1.453209,4.161949,0.370899,0.112101,0.562896,0.036377,0.11191,0.926501,0.000046,0.202067,0.201908,0.182336,0.156473,0.157843,0.15136,0.133088,0.027315,0.34776,0.327865,0.248971,0.31485,0.265087,0.106427,0.113864,0.122408,0.139028,0.119892,0.131644,0.022393,0.043096,0.07607,0.140055,0.256099,0.044031,0.844728,0.100837,0.043383,0.028675,0.07258,0.204243,4804.68047,9.306172,9.10273,0.001628,0.558293,0.316404,96.12346,5.331431,1.316272,0.709186,1.332805,0.888506,0.113986,160.2672,7.608705,598.0226,4.043211,0.087028,0.060935,0.401563,0.000244,0.006435,13701.81,3.454008,0,0.984021,0.091127,0,0.015734,0.001921,411.4466,371942.2,0.008511,0.005872,0.000068,-3.902122,-2.664764,-1.076912,0.974041,3.374682,-2.61952,-0.732355,-0.000355,2.008711,1.444751,0.051942,0.061172,0.067897,16.79882,0.150987,0.585493,0.000004,0.001102,0.2728,16.66209,8.701247,0.381972,9.398501,2.575732,0.407168,2.943696,2901,-0.346592,4.440845,0.835844,-3.734724,7.96318,1.177023,0.903073,-0.000001,0.80973,-0.002109,0.000087,-0.138028,0.000547,-0.025964,535,11.20553,sad

I stole the mule from Anthony—I helped Anne up upon it. and we rode to Coeur d'Alene—passed Harrison and Wallace. they were blasting out the tunnels—making way for the light of learning. <i>when Jesus comes a'calling</i> she said <i>he's coming round the mountain on a train</i>. . Yeah. It's my home—last night I dreamt that I grew wings. I found a place where they could hear me when I sing. . we floated on to Hanford in a lumber boat up river. past the fisheries and the mill towns like a stretch of future graveyards. she was driven to distraction—said <i>I wonder what will happen. when they find out they're mistaken—the land is too changed to ever change</i>. . we waded through the marketplace—someone's ship had come in. there was silver and begonias—dynamite and cattle. there were hearts as big as apples and apples in the shape of Mary's heart. I said <i>inside this gilded cage a songbird always looks so plain</i>. . Yeah. It's my home—last night I dreamt that I grew wings. I found a place where they could hear me when I sing.. . and so they came with cameras—breaking through the morning mist. press and businessmen—tycoons—Episcopal philanthropists. lost in their appraisal of the body of a woman. but all we saw were lowlands—clouds clung to mountains without strings. . and at last we saw some people... . at last we saw some people.... at last we saw some people huddled up against. the rain that was descending like railroad spikes and hammers. they were headed for the border—walking and then running. and then they were gone into the fog but Anne said underneath their jackets she saw wings,0.048676,0.038158,0.07339,6.696042,0.196225,0.000051,1.492653,4.043965,0.32954,0.119881,0.536179,0.026015,0.071651,1.005717,0.000053,0.198433,0.196163,0.174568,0.159018,0.160503,0.153207,0.141639,0.030866,0.316546,0.398734,0.272147,0.333821,0.24553,0.109538,0.094454,0.09727,0.100591,0.099651,0.075883,0.03291,0.039592,0.066087,0.136768,0.261563,0.027076,0.493768,0.116291,0.05183,0.038775,0.05328,0.203044,4614.226371,9.664317,10.312075,0.001572,0.538402,0.32416,93.65339,4.967357,1.270327,0.883296,1.375487,0.88727,0.066666,76.67051,7.279932,1969.235,3.478099,0.040403,0.134088,0.616777,0.000294,0.006265,5594.835,1.833828,0,0.979361,0.123282,0,0.020227,0.00127,442.8685,203036.7,0.0091,0.004082,0.000096,-2.321106,-1.382444,-1.234915,-0.363043,-1.165884,-0.492282,-3.520336,0.000938,-5.804977,-4.864094,0.049881,0.03438,0.049398,26.4864,0.141439,-0.036451,-0.000001,0.001428,-0.024503,19.10159,5.18365,0.677668,4.902831,3.586213,0.942952,4.065282,390,-0.162581,3.905796,1.134069,-4.344991,8.446031,1.334952,1.537378,-0.000006,1.305591,-0.00173,0.000122,-0.106145,0.000683,-0.168748,257,11.53957,sad

You may tire of me as our December sun is setting. 'Cause I'm not who I used to be . No longer easy on the eyes. But these wrinkles masterfully disguise . The youthful boy below. Who turned your way and saw . Something he was not looking for. Both a beginning and an end . But now he lives inside someone he does not recognize . When he catches his reflection on accident . . On the back of a motor bike . With your arms outstretched trying to take flight . Leaving everything behind . But even at our swiftest speed. We couldn't break from the concrete . In the city where we still reside. . And I have learned that even landlocked lovers yearn. For the sea like navy men . 'Cause now we say goodnight. From our own separate sides . Like brothers on a hotel bed . Like brothers on a hotel bed . Like brothers on a hotel bed . Like brothers on a hotel bed. . You may tire of me as our December sun is setting.

Stand on the old plateau. With a satellite dish and Geronimo's ghost. . Down in the Rio Del Sol. I sunk my suitcase alone. Filled up the Amazon. With snakes and vines and ropes for my clothes. . Me and Jane Doe and Rousseau. We've got nowhere to go. Walking through cactus and stones. With our bare hands mining for gold. . Down in the city so cold. Shining like razors in the sun.

Let me shout its common cause for things to fall apart. For radicals to ruin all that's right. I don't mean to flout the laws of government or heart. I just don't wanna lose your eye. . Wait for the ocean-bottled news. Fly-bys and radio balloons. We will sing of lesser traits. and play them for the magistrate. In groups of four or eight or twelve. Until they say "we might as well". . Grocery stores and cannonballs. Line up on my list of things I'll remember when I'm old. Water towers and Mid-west plains still in the abyss. Left unseen 'til we're further up the road. . Wait for the static stat airwaves. Land-locked ocean-side parades. We will bring our new debates. And sing them for the magistrate. In groups of four or eight or twelve. Until they say "we might as well". Hey<comma> hey<comma> hey<comma> we might as well. . These days are not fast. Times will not last. So they say<comma> but I'm having trouble believin'. Try to settle soft in the canopy we've lost. As you dance and sway and kiss with Costa Ricans. . These days are not fast. Times will not last.

There comes a time. A time in everyone's life. When nothing seems to go your way. Where nothing seems to turn out right. . There may come a time. When you just can't seem to find your place. And for every door you open. It seems like you get two slammed in your face. . That's when you need someone. Someone that you can call. When all your faith is gone. And it feels like you can't go on. . Let it be me. Let it be me. If it's a friend you need. Let it be me. Let it be me. . When it feels like you're always comin' up last. Pockets full of nothin' ain't got no cash. No matter where you turn . You ain't got no place to stand. You reach out for something and they slap your hand. . I remember all too well. Just how it feels to be all alone. To feel like you'd give anything. For just a little place you can call your own. . That's when you need someone. Someone that you can call. When all your faith is gone. And it feels like you can't go on. . Let it be me. Let it be me. If it's a friend you need. Let it be me.

The leading light of the age all wondered amongst. Themselves what I would do next. After all that I'd found in my travels around. The world was there anything else left?. "Gentlemen"<comma> I said<comma> "I've studied the maps". "And if what I'm thinking is right". "There's another new world at the top of the world". "For whoever can break through the ice". . I looked round the room in that way I once had. And I saw that they wanted belief. So I said "All I've got are my guts and my God". Then I paused<comma>"and the Annabelle Lee". Oh the Annabelle Lee<comma> I saw their eyes shine. The most beautiful ship in the sea. My Nina<comma> My Pinta<comma> My Santa Maria. My beautiful Annabelle Lee. . That spring we set sail as the crowd waved from shore. And on board the crew waved their hats. But I never had family just the Annabelle Lee. So I didn't have cause to look back. I just set the course north and I studied the charts. And toward dark I drifted toward sleep. And I dreamed of the fine deep harbor I'd find. Past the ice for my Annabelle Lee. . After that it got colder the world got quiet. It was never quite day or quite night. And the sea turned the color of sky turned the color. Of sea turned the color of ice. 'Til at last all around us was fastness. One vast glassy desert of arsenic white. And the waves that once lifted us. Sifted instead into drifts against Annabelle's sides. . The crew gathered closer at first for the comfort. But each morning would bring a new set. Of the tracks in the snow leading over the edge. Of the world 'til I was the only one left. After that it gets cloudy but it feels like I lay there. For days maybe for months. But Annabelle held me the two of us happy. Just to think back on all we had done. . We talked of the other worlds we'd discover. As she gave up her body to me. And as I chopped up her mainsail for timber. I told her of all that we still had to see. As the frost turned her moorings to nine-tail. And the wind lashed her sides in the cold. I burned her to keep me alive every night. In the lover's embrace of her hold. . I won't call it rescue what brought me here back to. The old world to drink and decline. And to pretend that the search for another new world. Was well-worth the burning of mine. But sometimes at night in my dreams comes the singing. Of some known tropical bird. And I smile in my sleep thinking Annabelle Lee. Has finally made it to another new world,0.078538,0.064043,0.123414,6.113171,0.062222,0.000303,1.576882,4.529446,0.28023,0.150022,0.562004,0.048878,0.104051,1.137584,0.000107,0.197079,0.188764,0.193282,0.158527,0.154456,0.152621,0.146323,0.032426,0.649445,0.281145,0.274289,0.333555,0.390666,0.113941,0.137277,0.12477,0.127291,0.103331,0.101954,0.028649,0.043611,0.074764,0.153799,0.26945,0.049297,0.901068,0.159188,0.053846,0.046912,0.059231,0.199852,6409.144424,12.483109,12.841982,0.00157,0.556231,0.31773,66.99106,4.30818,1.311196,0.604316,0.495472,0.879725,0.065347,59.59842,5.576135,752.9317,1.954858,0.045379,0.085073,0.109792,0.000227,0.006753,4315.058,1.75363,0,0.83755,0.09454,0,0.136151,0.003133,685.2029,603114.3,0.022661,0.027437,0.000485,-4.119941,-4.052538,-2.054936,0.27525,-6.936166,-3.279376,-1.836638,-0.001675,-3.782199,-6.390924,0.074909,0.083765,0.07374,22.1384,0.149833,-0.260771,0.000002,0.00348,0.467473,19.01377,11.95932,0.738785,7.037905,3.704427,0.815851,4.923929,778,-0.007869,4.433495,1.146421,-4.520633,9.294403,1.381341,1.209819,0.000001,1.204247,-0.005951,0.000189,-0.153213,0.00097,0.161134,2712,6.828381,sad

Two jumps in a week. I bet you think that's pretty clever. Don't you boy. Flying on your motorcycle. Watching all the ground beneath you drop. . You'd kill yourself for recognition. Kill yourself to never ever stop. You broke another mirror. You're turning into something you are not. . Don't leave me high. Don't leave me dry. Don't leave me high. Don't leave me dry. . Drying up in conversation. You will be the one who cannot talk. All your insides fall to pieces. You just sit there wishing you could still make love. . They're the ones who'll hate you. When you think you've got the world all sussed out. They're the ones who'll spit at you. You will be the one screaming out. . Don't leave me high. Don't leave me dry. Don't leave me high. Don't leave me dry. . It's the best thing that you ever had. The best thing that you ever<comma> ever had. It's the best thing that you ever had. The best thing you have had<comma> has gone away. . Don't leave me high. Don't leave me dry. Don't leave me high. Don't leave me dry. . Don't leave me high. Don't leave me high.

I saw Nick Drake . At the corner of time and motion. I caught his eye . And he caught mine. I said "You're tall.". He said "No taller than tomorrow's ocean.". I saw Nick Drake . And he was fine. . I saw Nick Drake. As we were carrying the ice together. I saw his face. Beneath the glass. The net was gone. And all the strawberries of English weather. I saw him pass. Right through this place. . I saw Nick Drake. The habits of a lifetime. Will lay you low. Into your grave. And when you're gone. You take the whole world with you. I saw Nick Drake. I saw him wave. .

Proved to be more than diversion. Sha-la-la-la<comma> later on. . And then sha-la-la-la-la<comma> he entered her slowly. And showed her where he was coming from. And then sha-la-la-la-la<comma> he made love to her gently. It was like she'd never ever come. And then sha-la-la-la-la<comma> sha-la-la-la-la. When the sun rose and he made to leave. You know<comma> sha-la-la-la-la<comma> sha-la-la-la-la. Neither one regretted a thing. . <i><b>Street Hassle</b></i>. Hey<comma> that cunt's not breathing. I think she's had too much. Of something or other<comma> hey<comma> man<comma> you know what I mean?. I don't mean to scare you. But you're the one who came here. And you're the one who's gotta take her when you leave. I'm not being smart. Or trying to be cold on my part. And I'm not gonna wear my heart on my sleeve. But you know people get all emotional. And sometimes<comma> man<comma> they just don't act rational you know. They think they're just on TV. . Sha-la-la-la<comma> man. Why don't you just slip her away. . You know<comma> I'm glad that we met man. It really was nice talking. And I really wish that there was a little more time to speak. But you know it could be a hassle. Trying to explain this all to a police officer. About how it was that your old lady got herself stiffed. And it's not like we could help. But there wasn't nothing no one could do. And if there was<comma> man<comma> you know I would have been the first. But when someone turns that blue. Well<comma> it's a universal truth. And then you just know that bitch will never fuck again. By the way<comma> that's really some bad shit. That you came to our place with. But you ought to be more careful around the little girls. It's either the best or it's the worst. And since I don't have to choose. I guess I won't and I know this ain't no way to treat a guest. But why don't you grab your old lady by the feet. And just lay her out in the darkest street. And by morning<comma> she's just another hit and run. You know<comma> some people got no choice. And they can never find a voice. To talk with that they can even call their own. So the first thing that they see. That allows them the right to be. Why they follow it<comma> you know<comma> it's called bad luck. . <i><b>Slipaway</b></i>. Well hey(man)<comma> that's just a lie. It's a lie she tells her friends. 'Cause the real song<comma> the real song. Where she won't even admit to herself. The beatin' in her heart. It's a song lots of people know. It's a painful song. A little sad truth. But life full of sad songs. Penny for a wish. But wishin' won't make you a soldier. With a pretty kiss for a pretty face. Can't have its way.

All the other girls here are stars - you are the northern lights. They try to shine in through your curtains - you're too close and too bright. They try and they try but everything that they do. Is the ghost of a trace of a pale imitation of you. I'll be the one to drive you back home Kathleen. . This party was made with the night air and the chance that a smile. Will wind its way from your face to one of the boys in your line. You act like you're hip to their tricks and you're strong. But a virgin Wurlitzer heart never once had a song. I'll be the one to drive you back home Kathleen. . And I'll have you back by break of day. I'm going your way anyway. And if you'd like to come along. I'll be yours for a song. . I know you are waiting and I know that it is not for me. But I'm here and I'm ready and I've saved you the passenger seat. I won't be your last dance just your last goodnight. Every heart is a package tangled up in knots someone else tied. I'll be the one to drive you back home Kathleen. . So crawl up your trellis and quietly back into your room. And I'll coast down the length of your drive by the light of the moon. And the next time I see you - a new kind of hello. Both our hearts have a secret only both of us know. 'Bout the night that I drove you back home Kathleen,0.038021,0.024698,0.042277,7.529939,0.034527,0.000036,1.433961,3.737455,0.338588,0.098214,0.507318,0.009962,0.030248,1.281555,0.000054,0.213483,0.20576,0.182435,0.167294,0.173628,0.146521,0.136923,0.020774,0.295126,0.1987,0.220477,0.209763,0.248843,0.101861,0.118799,0.115312,0.080432,0.060801,0.143795,0.015189,0.033922,0.063234,0.137973,0.255434,0.006363,0.540301,0.131714,0.036559,0.035799,0.04819,0.203254,3855.088883,6.968913,13.219624,0.001562,0.581214,0.306861,48.4742,3.081789,1.112845,1.179813,0.693185,0.885537,0.101275,57.72443,6.328808,126.7817,0.282271,0.013277,0.158804,0.223871,0.000212,0.009442,2511.106,1.152093,0,0.964048,0.130324,0,0.034683,0.002526,259.0434,11448.55,0.003308,0.004173,0.000003,3.546244,4.253268,-0.529614,-0.055689,-4.337571,0.992449,-12.68238,0.001224,-0.03578,-5.960745,0.036305,0.043004,0.018656,6.008062,0.181335,0.649167,0,0.000291,1.117409,6.820233,3.691531,2.040268,3.544454,6.022566,2.19137,5.61834,1278,0.117055,3.474296,3.258884,-8.880882,16.3998,3.504882,3.369671,-0.000002,3.31092,-0.000665,0.000015,-0.08985,0.000579,0.032564,1572,15.23876,notsad

Snow covers Whitehall. White powdered Nembutal. And I can't think any more. My feet are like ice. And the moon sets. On Christmas trees and plastic deer . . I decided to forgive and forget. I thank god you're comatose. As I pull back the bedclothes. And I can't believe my composure. And I can't remember my anger. And summer is a fish story.

There's a hundred hearts or three. Pumping blood to the roots of evil to keep them young . . Ah me all mine. Is it safe to say that we've waited patiently . Call me on time . And recall the tune that has placed us gracefully . All into line . There's a garden grave and a place there saved for you . I fall by your side . Though your silver-haired mama throws told-you so's . . We're laying in the shadow of your family tree. Your haunted heart and me. Brought down by an old idea whose time has come. And in the shadow of the gallows of your family tree. There's a hundred hearts or three. Pumping blood to the roots of evil to keep them young. . Now we're gathered in the shadow of your family tree. In halted harmony. Brought down by an old idea whose time has come . And in the shadow of the valley of your family tree. There's a hundred hearts or three.

Each bulb's a blinding sphere. In the secular nation. Unhurried sirens moan. Pitches that glaze my eyes. She's just a pale fleshy typewriter-light advertisement for a wind chime that emits rays which resonate in the polluted sky. . All entrances to the. Merritt blocked off I mean.

As the descent began I got the distinct impression. Lake Michigan had been frozen for decades. I conducted the warmth from my metronome sternum. To our massive jetting vessel billowing plumes of spent fuel. . The tundra under us cracked and ruptured. To reveal palisades. Made of blades of gray<comma> gray bristling grass. And papulose lichen. I was so frightened. As my grip on you tightened. Your skin got slicker. . I am a deserted bus depot. Though our approach suggested. An American hazy sea. Like the one I found inside.

I stole the mule from Anthony—I helped Anne up upon it. and we rode to Coeur d'Alene—passed Harrison and Wallace. they were blasting out the tunnels—making way for the light of learning. <i>when Jesus comes a'calling</i> she said <i>he's coming round the mountain on a train</i>. .

I found a place where they could hear me when I sing. . we floated on to Hanford in a lumber boat up river. past the fisheries and the mill towns like a stretch of future graveyards. she was driven to distraction—said <i>I wonder what will happen. when they find out they're mistaken—the land is too changed to ever change</i>. . we waded through the marketplace—someone's ship had come in. there was silver and begonias—dynamite and cattle. there were hearts as big as apples and apples in the shape of Mary's heart. I said <i>inside this gilded cage a songbird always looks so plain</i>. . Yeah. It's my home—last night I dreamt that I grew wings. I found a place where they could hear me when I sing.. . and so they came with cameras—breaking through the morning mist. press and businessmen—tycoons—Episcopal philanthropists. lost in their appraisal of the body of a woman. but all we saw were lowlands—clouds clung to mountains without strings. . and at last we saw some people... . at last we saw some people.... at last we saw some people huddled up against. the rain that was descending like railroad spikes and hammers. they were headed for the border—walking and then running. and then they were gone into the fog but Anne said underneath their jackets she saw wings,0.048676,0.038158,0.07339,6.696042,0.196225,0.000051,1.492653,4.043965,0.32954,0.119881,0.536179,0.026015,0.071651,1.005717,0.000053,0.198433,0.196163,0.174568,0.159018,0.160503,0.153207,0.141639,0.030866,0.316546,0.398734,0.272147,0.333821,0.24553,0.109538,0.094454,0.09727,0.100591,0.099651,0.075883,0.03291,0.039592,0.066087,0.136768,0.261563,0.027076,0.493768,0.116291,0.05183,0.038775,0.05328,0.203044,4614.226371,9.664317,10.312075,0.001572,0.538402,0.32416,93.65339,4.967357,1.270327,0.883296,1.375487,0.88727,0.066666,76.67051,7.279932,1969.235,3.478099,0.040403,0.134088,0.616777,0.000294,0.006265,5594.835,1.833828,0,0.979361,0.123282,0,0.020227,0.00127,442.8685,203036.7,0.0091,0.004082,0.000096,-2.321106,-1.382444,-1.234915,-0.363043,-1.165884,-0.492282,-3.520336,0.000938,-5.804977,-4.864094,0.049881,0.03438,0.049398,26.4864,0.141439,-0.036451,-0.000001,0.001428,-0.024503,19.10159,5.18365,0.677668,4.902831,3.586213,0.942952,4.065282,390,-0.162581,3.905796,1.134069,-4.344991,8.446031,1.334952,1.537378,-0.000006,1.305591,-0.00173,0.000122,-0.106145,0.000683,-0.168748,257,11.53957,notsad

Baby canteen<comma> when i thought your heart stopped beating. The room brought out the silence in your breathing. A birth in wooded housing will help you live beyond the numbers. Let us pray to pan let in the light. And see us bathe and sleep among us. Smell the body of our elders. And wake up to the milky way at breakfast. I'll take the time to pick up all the widow makers broken . No real way to remember if we'll work again. . Color people say oh no<comma> cause they think it's contagious. Marshmallow people say oh yeah<comma> cause they think it's a masterpiece. . The sky has brakes . What a good day to rise. De Soto De Son will time. . Goodbye blue heron goodbye green fly goodbye goodbye. . I've got a raft you'll sail till the open lie in the lake. While your body is broken . When you go out I'll cry in the thicket. Shooting from school. There's a green where the crickets cry mom can't breathe and i know she's leaving. And that the birds of a quay are all good for the crocodile. So slow it down. Its not a race. Death takes time. Do you see it?. . Baby canteen swollen fingers in the water . I roped an Island pony for your birthday. I'll live in wooded housing till they put out all your needles. And drop you in and shelter near the highway,0.087463,0.071548,0.126292,5.204094,-0.168801,0.000014,1.609928,4.079983,0.497392,0.186562,0.566717,0.017639,0.045809,0.586459,0.000005,0.228699,0.183592,0.194586,0.168643,0.185517,0.174321,0.15712,0.028051,0.277392,0.242,0.255436,0.253625,0.305589,0.108414,0.141564,0.094716,0.134576,0.07257,0.039234,0.024831,0.035913,0.07059,0.134543,0.257237,0.009606,0.349753,0.120579,0.053071,0.037715,0.055206,0.20459,3719.386762,11.055017,13.007743,0.001565,0.569971,0.329971,84.41511,5.094339,1.403113,0.529878,0.704862,0.881129,0.074853,61.86778,5.439697,247.8309,0.353186,0.006719,0.015547,0.026144,0.000197,0.003599,1952.656,0.677888,0,0.968043,0.124894,0,0.030957,0.002239,786.2035,45133.17,0.006323,0.005143,0.000008,-9.314275,-11.54612,-0.400027,-0.359404,-9.096987,-8.238069,-9.231399,-0.000169,2.565216,0.798674,0.084495,0.097421,0.029225,4.093875,0.145553,0.212612,0,0.000466,1.69583,11.67626,4.785002,0.213436,3.729022,2.22668,0.314496,1.999101,2900,-0.037726,2.978405,0.638545,-3.312994,7.5021,0.858102,0.725836,-0.000002,0.806167,0.002336,0.000022,-0.106886,0.000591,1.101589,2508,9.50724,notsad

Bass in your face. Not an eight track. Gettin' it good to the wood. So the people. Give you some a dat. Reactin' to the fax. That I kick and it stick. And it stay around. Pointin' to the joint<comma> put the Buddha down. Goin'<comma> goin'<comma> gettin' to the roots. Ain't givin' it up. So turn me loose. But then again I got a story. That's harder than the hardcore. Cost of the holocaust. I'm talin' 'bout the one still goin' on. I know. Where I'm from<comma> not dum diddie dum. From the base motherland. The place of the drum. Invaded by the wack diddie wack. Fooled the black<comma> left us faded. King and chief probably had a big beef. Because of dat now I grit my teeth. So here's a song to the strong. 'Bout a shake of a snake. And the smile went along wit dat. Can't truss it. Kickin' wicked rhymes. Like a fortune teller. 'Cause the wickedness done by Jack. Where everybody at. Divided and sold. For liquor and the gold. Smacked in the back. For the other man to mack. Now the story that I'm kickin' is gory. Little Rock where they be. Dockin' this boat. No hope I'm shackled. Plus gang tackled. By the other hand swingin' the rope. Wearin' red<comma> white and blue Jack and his crew. The guy's authorized beat down for the brown. Man to the man<comma> each one so it teach one. Born to terrorize sisters and every brother. One love who said it. I know Whodini sang it. But the hater taught hate. That's why we gang bang it. Beware of the hand. When it's comin' from the left. I ain't trippin' just watch ya step. Can't truss it. An I judge everyone<comma> one by the one. Look here come the judge. Watch it here he come now. I can only guess what's happ'nin'. Years ago he woulda been. The ships captain. Gettin' me bruised on a cruise. What I got to lose<comma> lost all contact. Got me layin' on my back. Rollin' in my own leftover. When I roll over<comma> I roll over in somebody else's. 90 F--kin' days on a slave ship. Count 'em fallin' off 2<comma> 3<comma> 4 hun'ed at a time. Blood in the wood and it's mine. I'm chokin' on spit feelin' pain. Like my brain bein' chained. Still gotta give it what I got. But it's hot in the day<comma> cold in the night. But I thrive to survive<comma> I pray to god to stay alive. Attitude boils up inside. And that ain't it (think I'll every quit). Still I pray to get my hands 'round. The neck of the man wit' the whip. 3 months pass<comma> they brand a label on my ass. To signify. Owned. I'm on the microphone. Sayin' 1555. How I'm livin'. We been livin' here. Livin' ain't the word. I been givin'. Haven't got. Classify us in the have-nots. Fightin' haves. 'Cause it's all about money. When it comes to Armageddon. Mean I'm getting mine. Here I am turn it over Sam. 427 to the year. Do you understand. That's why it's hard. For the black to love the land. Once again. Bass in your face. Not an eight track. Gettin' it good to the wood.

Blue textures cascade downward to the base of the monolith. Like brush strokes on a canvas of souls. Two arms reach out a cloak of silent nihil. Revenants untouched by the scythe. They are lost in the dark woods of time. . Aloft in the landscape that you hail. I am the fog that seeps over here in the early hours. . Standing proud in the hollow of the land. A vestige of deeper purity etched in spirit agaisnt the sky. . The menhir had runes carved in limbs of oaken sovereignty. and could see the ages growing from within the palms. I can feel the era slipping into oblivion<comma>. no longer grasping the textures. I am slowly becoming stone. . As wolves celebrate the dusk<comma>. an old voice of wisdom haunts the vale. . Shapes flicker in the fire light through the windows. The woodlands burn with grace. Their silence drowns the age. . As wandering ghosts pass through the flames. A new age of rebirth lights the dawn. . But who are they who pass by the window?. The shapes; like black solar wheels scorched in the snow. by gods of the stone.... This elder stone shall never fall!. . Cast the aeons into the void. So that no other can seek them. No age<comma> no hands shall taint them. Pour the sorrows into the sun. They are lost forever in dark woods of time. Carve the symbols into the stone. So that another can find them. No age<comma> no hands shall change them. Pour the ages into the sun.

Breathe life to the street from the mouth. Those ruby red lips have much to give. Pull life from the land with your capable hands. Those life loving beautiful broken hands. Oh<comma> I'll stand with you and marvel. At the cosmos pink and bright. All the pages flipping backwards. Til time is gone and wrong is right. . Rivers running up the hills and to the sky and down to the sea. Where a merman with a twinkle casts a hook in me. . Sing me a salty blue song<comma> I'll be gone. With watery cheeks down flowered lanes. Tattered sails on a ramshackle ship<comma> I'll go pale. Staring straight in the face looming tempest waves. Otherwise I'll wither and die here. On this reach of rubble rambling. With two years filled up with sand<comma> dear. In a broken daze I'll be scrambling. . Like rivers running up the hills and to the sky and down to the sea. Where a merman with a twinkle casts a hook in me. . Summer sky falling into the sea<comma> taking part of me. See the bones on the sand in the light. All the heards of the sea rushing by<comma> pay no mind. To the dancing reflections gone wild. And at night a fractured star fell. And pierced right through the thick of me. I cried out in pain and joy<comma> yes. I'm not dead<comma> not numb<comma> not withering. . Like a falling leaf who keeps her green. I'm turning bright in the sea.

Juxtaposed to B.B.D. and O. Beyond San Fernando on hillside manors on the banks of toxicity those below and those above the same.. . Dreams are still born in Hollywood I don't understand.. Just suppose the youngster knows he's had a good deal of fortune and up through the babble on the fair banks complicity<comma>. Buy your leave or stay beyond the game.. . Palm Desert not fade away.. Palm Desert I wish I could stay.. Palm Desert sages abound.. So head your head to the ground round.. . Meanwhile in the wild west of Hollywood age is losing hold..

By the time I filter down to you. A finger for an invitation. Too sane to find the feel. Cotton blood<comma> a jewelry box. . The last to leave<comma> the last to come.

(Chorus x15). Make you feel that way. . (Verse One). Up an early for the hope of a brand new day. See a homie you ain't seen since back in the day. Fresh haircut fitted wit a fat ass fade. End of work<comma> we chilling on a Saturday. How you felt when you first heard the data came. Rakim KRS hey I had that tape. Cooling out with ol girl on a fat ass date. Find a hundred dollar bill wow man that's great. Get promoted at your job up to management. Plot a long time finally a plan has made it. Time I feel I wanna shout<comma> man its real that way. Wanna think of things that make you feel that way. . (Chorus x15). . (Verse Two). Christmas day when your mamma got your first bike. Type of feeling when you went and when your first fight. How your team felt winning championship games. Celebrate in a huddle dancing in this rain. Have a thought see a shooting star cross your screen. Put in hard work finally your living your dream. Deaf man get his hearing now in come vibes. Blind man get sight see his first sunrise . Dumb man speaking out<comma> now he's load and clear. Earth through your chout smile so proud ya wear. Going in your third eye for the styles ya hear. Making music that'll bump for a thousand years. Eating right feeling conscience like health is first. Said a prayer that's sincere and you felt it work. Times I feel I wanna shout<comma> man it's real that way. When I'm thinking things that make you feel that way. . (Chorus x15). . (Verse Three). All up in her vibe something coming over me. Summer days more likely that you notice breezes. Winter days more likely that you notice heat. When I'm warm more likely that you notice me. In the dark it's more likely that you notice light. In the light more likely that you notice night. Hungry more appreciation for that meal. Dead broke more appreciation for that grill. A bad day'll make you really notice ones that's good. And that'll make things a little better understood. Times I feel I wanna shout<comma> man it's real that way. When I think of things that make you feel that way. Make you feel that way.... . (Ya know its like ahh like the most greatest feeling you could ever feel. you like just total illation. Sunny day<comma> just that day.. You know its just like you know just the most joyous feeling. you could ever comprehend. You know<comma> chilling with your family..

Cigarettes and carrot juice. Get yourself a new tattoo. For those sleeveless days of June. I'm sitting on the Cafe Xeno's steps. With a book I haven't started yet. Watching all the girls walk by. . Could I take you out. I'd be yours without a doubt. On that big dipper. And if the sound of this it frightens you. We could play it real cool. And act somewhat indifferent. . And hey June. Why'd you have to come. Why'd you have to come around so soon. I wasn't ready for all this nature. The terrible green<comma> green grass. The violent blooms of flower dresses. And afternoons that make me sleepy. . But we could wait awhile. Before we push that dull turnstile. Into the passage. The thousands they have tread. And others sometimes fled. Before the turn came. . And we could wait our lives. Before a chance arrives. Before the passage. From the top you can see Monterey. Or think about San Jose. Although I know it's not that pleasant. . And hey Jim Kerouac. Brother of the famous Jack. Or so he likes to say<comma> lucky bastard. He's sitting on the cafe's inner steps. With a girl that I'm not over yet. Watching all the world go by. . Boy you're looking bad. Did I make you feel that sad?. I'm honestly flattered. But if she asks me out. I'd be hers without a doubt. On that big dipper. . A Cigarette and carrot juice.

Concentric circles signal dinner time. The tidal waves that skim the surface. We'll split along the seeds<comma> we've all been gnawing at the bone. And your last breath left us dangling from your spine. And that was fine. Yeah<comma> your last breath left us hanging on the line. Wonder why you never lose. . After all the hair falls from your head. And the heart attack's been sleeping in your bed. But on with the restoration. . I'm running on my feet<comma> I never stumble as I'm falling.

Per ricominciare da zero. Non restare fuori dal giro. Non è sincero. Ma in fondo chi lo è stato mai. Vorrei solo diventar più leggero. . Restar soli. Centomila storie e la mia.

We only answer to ourselves . Answer to ourselves . Why does my sleep tell me of lies . Waking life full of rotten surprise . Why do all the strangers care . Who knows who is there . If you are here and I am where? . Trapped in the cell of your own brain . Blood is scarcely moving through your shriveled veins . Don't let yourself pass you by . It can happen in the blink of an eye . There'll be no bad dreams . When you're lying next to me . I don't care about the rules . We only answer to ourselves . Until we fall awake . I feel old now you seem young . I spent too much time out in the sun . I got a wrinkle to show for every day . Give 'em back to me again .

Did I burn each last bit of myself. Did I turn my back on the kid in myself. And tear the oldest root. In a charlatan's pursuit. And the world difting farther away. . On the run with nowhere to hide. The black angel still clings to my side. You know he's faster than. Any man. And the world drifting further away. . What I told you lover I guess that I meant. By the time that you read this I will have repented. I know I am a fool. For trying to play it cruel. And you played so much kinder than I. . Your memory now is the shadow to my shadow. I wind it tight like a player piano. Your skirt above your knees. I watch you press the keys. It calms the smarting flesh. Of the wound we have undressed. . If still there's a song deep in this marrow. Who lets you draw that last shivering arrow. What kind of smarting loon. Believes that he can shoot the moon. Calm these frailing nerves. They ask to be preserved. . I was ashamed and mute. Fumbling around for my parachute. Then gliding through the rain. Not a drop could leave its stain. And the world drifting farther away,0.035038,0.024854,0.056844,7.228909,0.328754,0.000176,1.482165,4.501692,0.378503,0.104369,0.519069,0.015394,0.070762,0.874613,0.000165,0.201525,0.186251,0.182808,0.170582,0.161707,0.148576,0.162677,0.032919,0.469458,0.225982,0.306624,0.238755,0.279676,0.12031,0.12724,0.096761,0.095347,0.104443,0.140138,0.028612,0.043865,0.065913,0.12981,0.255347,0.018941,0.678677,0.1108,0.038629,0.03805,0.059932,0.205379,4911.991551,19.597747,9.181053,0.001544,0.515476,0.315345,54.62612,3.132899,1.073257,0.823555,0.484191,0.868692,0.070064,103.0681,7.400315,181.7807,0.681208,0.029327,0.068692,0.148081,0.00085,0.004131,6266.207,2.681218,0,0.849534,0.092839,0,0.127911,0.002445,257.7633,55005.54,0.007494,0.007157,0.000021,1.032209,0.458851,-1.376674,0.009541,0.923715,-1.962135,-0.296088,0.000457,-0.529808,-1.710619,0.031404,0.039146,0.032218,32.38018,0.17428,0.454574,0.000003,0.000897,1.589195,18.04352,11.67808,0.578476,6.679215,3.744088,0.700506,3.163736,2599,-0.194407,3.639429,1.008697,-3.821505,8.275314,1.05212,0.954488,0,0.96414,-0.00108,0.000036,-0.121349,0.000629,-0.095712,533,7.115879,notsad
