Conquistador your stallion stands . in need of company . and like some angel's haloed brow . you reek of purity . I see your armour-plated breast . has long since lost its sheen . and in your death mask face . there are no signs which can be seen . . And though I hoped for something to find . I could see no maze to unwind . . Conquistador a vulture sits . upon your silver shield . and in your rusty scabbard now . the sand has taken seed . and though your jewel-encrusted blade . has not been plundered still . the sea has washed across your face . and taken of its fill . . And though I hoped for something to find . I could see no maze to unwind . . Conquistador there is no time . I must pay my respect . and though I came to jeer at you .

And forget what you wanted to say. . Little bird. Little bird. Brush your gray wings on my head. Say what you said. Say it again. They tell me I'm crazy. But you told me. I'm golden. Sometimes it's hard to tell the truth from the lies. Nobody knows what's in the hold of your minds. We are all building and people inside. Never know who walks through the door. Is it someone that you've met before. . Little bird. Little Bird. Brush your gray wings on my head. Say what you said. Say it again. They tell me I'm crazy. But you told me. I'm golden.

A man made of butterfat. Careening around on a Sno-Cat. And I can't drive any faster. My hands are like ice and the moon shines. On pepper trees and road grease. The yellow lines look blue . . Snow covers Whitehall. White powdered Nembutal. And I can't think any more. My feet are like ice. And the moon sets. On Christmas trees and plastic deer . . I decided to forgive and forget. I thank god you're comatose. As I pull back the bedclothes. And I can't believe my composure. And I can't remember my anger. And summer is a fish story.

Don't plagiarise or take 'on loan'. There's always someone<comma> somewhere. With a big nose who knows. And who trips you up and laughs. When you fall. Who'll trip you up and laugh. When you fall. You say: "Ere long done do does did". Words which could only be your own. And then produce the text. From whence was ripped. 'Some dizzy whore'<comma> 1804. A dreaded sunny day. So let's go where we're happy. And I meet you at the cemetry gates. Oh Keats and Yeats are on your side. A dreaded sunny day. So let's go where we're wanted. And I meet you at the cemetry gates. Keats and Yeats are on your side. But you lose. 'Cause weird lover Wilde is on mine.

All the other girls here are stars - you are the northern lights. They try to shine in through your curtains - you're too close and too bright. They try and they try but everything that they do. Is the ghost of a trace of a pale imitation of you. I'll be the one to drive you back home Kathleen. . This party was made with the night air and the chance that a smile. Will wind its way from your face to one of the boys in your line. You act like you're hip to their tricks and you're strong. But a virgin Wurlitzer heart never once had a song. I'll be the one to drive you back home Kathleen. . And I'll have you back by break of day. I'm going your way anyway. And if you'd like to come along. I'll be yours for a song. . I know you are waiting and I know that it is not for me. But I'm here and I'm ready and I've saved you the passenger seat. I won't be your last dance just your last goodnight. Every heart is a package tangled up in knots someone else tied. I'll be the one to drive you back home Kathleen. . So crawl up your trellis and quietly back into your room. And I'll coast down the length of your drive by the light of the moon. And the next time I see you - a new kind of hello. Both our hearts have a secret only both of us know.

A rattraper tout le temps perdu<comma> toutes ces heures investies. A gagner tous toute une vie. On ne peut stocker l'amour au fond d'un puits. Car c'est au jour le jour qu'on le construit. Profite de chaque instant vécu. N'avoir aucun regret lorsque tout ici sera fini !. J'ai les mains pleines de richesses mais je ne parle pas d'argent. Car on progresse dans notre voie passionnément.

By building up the means for war<comma> we thus preserve the peace. Such bullshit will prepare us for invasion from the east. And meanwhile<comma> they're carving up the land. The anglo-american military have taken full command. It's keeping us fed we're consuming it all. Fat on its culture and military control. Preparing for war bit by bit. Whilst we're watching its telly and eating its shit. They've got it all worked out and we give our consent. They've got it all worked out and we give our consent. They've got it all worked out and we give our consent. They've got it all worked out for Central America. They've got it all worked out for Ireland. By sitting back and keeping silent we give them our consent. Born in the shadow of the USA. Taught the fundamental bullshit every day. Force fed on a diet of Great British lies. Media distortions censor our minds. Passive spectators of royalty. Too diverted to care if we're free. ICI<comma> BP<comma> Thorn EMI. Red<comma> white<comma> and blue logos<comma> British pride. With a Big Mac in one hand and a Coke at our sides. We've accepted their culture and swallowed their lies. They've put up more fences<comma> watched us and spied. And cleverly told us they've got nothing to hide. For too long we've watched them preparing for battle. But the fightback is started little by little. Kicking at the midst of passive defense. Refusing cruise means tearing down fences. At Greenham and Molesworth<comma> fences you can see. But then there's all the barriers that are built around me. Political<comma> economic<comma> cultural<comma> social. And people who live in glass houses. Shouldn't encourage others to throw stones. Let the glossy shop fronts know what to expect.

Red over white . Fishermen working at night . Not even once . Did we see a light . We didn't realize . The forecast had been revised . By moonless skies and. Shifty wind that gusts and dies. . On the sand our keel is heaving . But tonight we've got to be leaving. Travel through the day and into the evening . . Marathon how long we've been gone . And still not yet set foot upon you . . Your low lying shore opens welcomingly. To one who's spent the night at sea. Adrift in the shallows<comma> a modest repose. Adorn with coral<comma> your bright colors show.
