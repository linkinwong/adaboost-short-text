Baby's on fire. Better throw her in the water. Look at her laughing. Like a heifer to the slaughter. . Baby's on fire. And all the laughing boys are bitching. Waiting for photos.

And that's what baby's been reduced to. . Juanita and Juan. Very clever with maracas. Making their fortunes. Selling secondhand tobaccoes. . Juan dances at Chico's. And when the clients are evicted. He empties the ashtrays. And pockets all that he's collected. . But baby's on fire. And all the instruments agree that. Her temperature's rising. But any idiot would know that,nothigh

A vestige of deeper purity etched in spirit agaisnt the sky. . The menhir had runes carved in limbs of oaken sovereignty. and could see the ages growing from within the palms. I can feel the era slipping into oblivion<comma>. no longer grasping the textures. I am slowly becoming stone. . As wolves celebrate the dusk<comma>. an old voice of wisdom haunts the vale. . Shapes flicker in the fire light through the windows. The woodlands burn with grace. Their silence drowns the age. . As wandering ghosts pass through the flames. A new age of rebirth lights the dawn. . But who are they who pass by the window?. The shapes; like black solar wheels scorched in the snow. by gods of the stone....

(Chorus x15). Make you feel that way. . (Verse One). Up an early for the hope of a brand new day. See a homie you ain't seen since back in the day. Fresh haircut fitted wit a fat ass fade. End of work<comma> we chilling on a Saturday. How you felt when you first heard the data came. Rakim KRS hey I had that tape. Cooling out with ol girl on a fat ass date. Find a hundred dollar bill wow man that's great. Get promoted at your job up to management. Plot a long time finally a plan has made it. Time I feel I wanna shout<comma> man its real that way. Wanna think of things that make you feel that way. . (Chorus x15). . (Verse Two). Christmas day when your mamma got your first bike. Type of feeling when you went and when your first fight. How your team felt winning championship games. Celebrate in a huddle dancing in this rain. Have a thought see a shooting star cross your screen. Put in hard work finally your living your dream. Deaf man get his hearing now in come vibes. Blind man get sight see his first sunrise . Dumb man speaking out<comma> now he's load and clear. Earth through your chout smile so proud ya wear. Going in your third eye for the styles ya hear. Making music that'll bump for a thousand years. Eating right feeling conscience like health is first. Said a prayer that's sincere and you felt it work. Times I feel I wanna shout<comma> man it's real that way. When I'm thinking things that make you feel that way. . (Chorus x15). . (Verse Three). All up in her vibe something coming over me. Summer days more likely that you notice breezes. Winter days more likely that you notice heat. When I'm warm more likely that you notice me. In the dark it's more likely that you notice light. In the light more likely that you notice night. Hungry more appreciation for that meal. Dead broke more appreciation for that grill. A bad day'll make you really notice ones that's good. And that'll make things a little better understood. Times I feel I wanna shout<comma> man it's real that way. When I think of things that make you feel that way. Make you feel that way.... . (Ya know its like ahh like the most greatest feeling you could ever feel. you like just total illation. Sunny day<comma> just that day.. You know its just like you know just the most joyous feeling. you could ever comprehend. You know<comma> chilling with your family.. You know just you know just really really feeling<comma>. feeling the moment<comma> with the folks. Ya know really really really just chilling.. It's love. It's love. It's love),nothigh
