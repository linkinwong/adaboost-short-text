And in the eyes of all these people. Don't you know that this could start. On any street in any town. In any state if any clown. Decides that now's the time to fight. For some ideal he thinks is right. And if a million more agree. There ain't no great society. As it applies to you and me. Our country isn't free. And the law refuses to see. If all that you can ever be. Is just a lousy janitor. Unless your uncle owns a store. You know that five in every four. Just one amount and nothin' more. Don't watch the rats go across the floor. And make up songs about being poor. Blow you harmonica son!,high.
