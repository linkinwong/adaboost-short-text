I think I'm goin' back. To the things I learned so well in my youth. I think I'm returning to. Those days when I was young enough to know the truth. Now there are no games. To only pass the time. No more electric trains. No more trees to climb. But thinking young and growing older is no sin. And I can play the game of life to win. . I can recall a time . When I wasn't ashamed to reach out to a friend. Now I think I've got. A lot more than just my toys to lend. Now there's more to do. Than watch my sailboat glide. But every day can be . A magic carpet ride. A little bit of courage is all we lack. So catch me if you can<comma> I'm goin' back. . La la la la la<comma> etc. . Now there's more to do. Than watch my sailboat glide.

What you want is just outside your reach. You keep on searchin’. You’re walking down that Pensacola beach. You keep repeatin’. . While you’re waiting for that sound. Apparatus to the ground. You’re stealing from the lost and found. But what you find. Ain’t what you had in mind. . Until you find your Rolex in the sand. You won’t be stopping. Until that solid gold is in your hand. You'll be happy. Call your office on the phone. Say you won’t be coming home. You fell into. Vacations on our own,high.
