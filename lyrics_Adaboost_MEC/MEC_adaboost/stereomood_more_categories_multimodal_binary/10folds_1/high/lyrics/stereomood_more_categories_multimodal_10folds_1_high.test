Bobby went out for a joy ride with my best girl<comma> left me at the party<comma>. It was almost June and the three-quarter moon illuminated . The rain-soaked streets like a candy wrapper..

By building up the means for war<comma> we thus preserve the peace. Such bullshit will prepare us for invasion from the east. And meanwhile<comma> they're carving up the land. The anglo-american military have taken full command. It's keeping us fed we're consuming it all. Fat on its culture and military control. Preparing for war bit by bit. Whilst we're watching its telly and eating its shit. They've got it all worked out and we give our consent. They've got it all worked out and we give our consent. They've got it all worked out and we give our consent. They've got it all worked out for Central America. They've got it all worked out for Ireland. By sitting back and keeping silent we give them our consent. Born in the shadow of the USA. Taught the fundamental bullshit every day. Force fed on a diet of Great British lies. Media distortions censor our minds. Passive spectators of royalty. Too diverted to care if we're free. ICI<comma> BP<comma> Thorn EMI. Red<comma> white<comma> and blue logos<comma> British pride. With a Big Mac in one hand and a Coke at our sides. We've accepted their culture and swallowed their lies. They've put up more fences<comma> watched us and spied. And cleverly told us they've got nothing to hide. For too long we've watched them preparing for battle. But the fightback is started little by little. Kicking at the midst of passive defense. Refusing cruise means tearing down fences. At Greenham and Molesworth<comma> fences you can see. But then there's all the barriers that are built around me. Political<comma> economic<comma> cultural<comma> social. And people who live in glass houses. Shouldn't encourage others to throw stones. Let the glossy shop fronts know what to expect. And colonel Sanders<comma> you're next,nothigh
