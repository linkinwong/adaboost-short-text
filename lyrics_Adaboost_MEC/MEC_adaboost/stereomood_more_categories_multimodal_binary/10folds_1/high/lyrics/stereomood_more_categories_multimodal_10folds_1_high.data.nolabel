How does the motion make me last. I shuffle forward and then back. I can be questioning my thoughts. But not looking for what I lack. . What is it that has my mind so hypnotized. When shapes are for looking at. And their colors create my mood. I'm a vessel between two places I've never been. . To seek a further or former design. Creation as a pathogen. What's more than subtle in these lines. I know you're looking forward to them. . What is it that has my mind so hypnotized. Evolving on a thought that you've half realized.

They took a picture. And from this cold lightning living me through. So I feel like an alarm clock. Fire came from my mouth Is pushing me around. And I'm not loving and I'm not hating. I'm not creating. I'm losing my friends and my young dreams. That was vicious air spilled in my face out of love. And out of love. Keep walking . If I did the same thing 500 times . Could you see it in the dark?. I trust the weather. I try to make the bodies give me strength. Do we see them in the yard?. Who cares in they're rolling in bed?. There's only darkness upstairs. Does love sit cold 'til you put in somewhere. Do objects split it at your heart?. I don't see that anymore. I'm colder and colder and colder

As we fall into sequence. And we're eating our young. Remain silent and still for modesty. . When the splints have been broken. And they can't help you now.

You tried to taste me. I taped my tongue to the southern tip of your body. Our bones are too heavy to come up. Squished into a single cell of wood. . And I made an excuse.

Old bodies slip when they make love. We'll mine our sparks to shoot above us

Still you're waiting for nothing.. She: Please do that thing you wanted me to do.. He: Where's that person I met when I met you?

To get so up for it. . Know you can count on me. I'll be so up for it. Know at least I'll try. . Who are you if I'm not up for it. Where are you if I'm not up for it. . Want to put a bubble 'round you. Like a force field switch. Keep you secure just a little bit. . But I know a secret child is just a silly trick. Who grows up to lose that force field switch. . In between a hands on and a hands off apprenticeship. Where are you if I'm not up for it. I'll wake up for it. . Know you can count on me. Know you can count on me. Know you can count on me. To get so up for it. . Know you can count on me. I'll be so up for it. Know at least I'll try

Because you were always unnoticed. You were always the flame that dies<comma>. Bastard with a flat-top singing<comma> "The Cloud of Unknowing"<comma>. Bastard with a flat-top singing<comma> "There's a flame<comma> a flame<comma> a flame<comma>. A flame that never dies.". . Because you were always unfocused<comma>.

20 years of schooling. I just never learned the math. That one and one don't equal two. They often equal half. . I have tried to live the high life. The best that I know how. And I bought my share of debonair. And parlayed it on the crowd. . I do believe that there's no more tricks up my sleeve. The good old days have past and the good times after that. And slowly I've become undone. A stranger with a stranger heart. . Well I plan to hit the bottom. The bottle then the top. And I pray that something quits me. Before I gotta stop. . Cause the masquerade is over. But I was barely there. The mask come off the gilded cloth. Yet I'm just barely there. . I do believe that there's no more tricks up my sleeve. The good old days have past and the good times after that. And slowly I've become undone. A stranger with a stranger heart
Going down a dirty inner city side road . I plotted. Madness passed me by<comma> she smiled hi. I nodded. Looked up as the sky began to cry. She shot it.. Met a girl from Dearborn<comma> early six o'clock this morn. A cold fact. Asked about her bag<comma> suburbia's such a drag. Won't go back. 'Cos Papa don't allow no new ideas here. And now he sees the news<comma> but the picture's not too clear.. Mama<comma> Papa<comma> stop . Treasure what you got. Soon you may be caught. Without it. The curfew's set for eight. Will it ever all be straight. I doubt it.. 7 jealous fools playing by her rules . Can't believe her . He feels so in between<comma> can't break the scene . It would grieve her . And that's the reason why he must cry. He'll never leave her. . Crooked children<comma> yellow chalk. writing on the concrete walk . Their King died . Drinking from a Judas cup<comma> . looking down but seeing up . Sweet red wine. 'Cos Papa don't allow no new ideas here . And now you hear the music. but the words don't sound too clear.. Mama<comma> Papa<comma> stop . Treasure what you got. Soon you may be caught. Without it. The curfew's set for eight. Will it ever all be straight. I doubt it.. Going down a dusty<comma> Georgian side road. I wonder. The wind splashed in my face. can smell a trace. Of thunder.
Well I'm about to get sick. From watchin' my TV. Been checkin' out the news. Until my eyeballs fail to see. I mean to say that every day. Is just another rotten mess. And when it's gonna change<comma> my friends. Is anybody's guess. . So I'm watchin' and I'm waitin'. Hopin' for the best. Even think I'll go to prayin'. Every time I hear 'em sayin'. That there's no way to delay. That trouble comin' every day. No way to delay. That trouble comin' every day. . Wednesday I watched the riot.... I seen the cops out on the street. Watched 'em throwin' rocks and stuff. And chokin' in the heat. Listened to reports. About the whisky passin' 'round. Seen the smoke & fire. And the market burnin' down. Watched while everybody. On his street would take a turn. To stomp and smash and bash and crash. And slash and bust and burn. . And I'm watchin' and I'm waitin'. Hopin' for the best. Even think I'll go to prayin'. Every time I hear 'em sayin'. That there's no way to delay. That trouble comin' every day. No way to delay. That trouble comin' every day. . Well you can cool it<comma>. You can heat it.... 'Cause<comma> baby<comma> I don't need it.... Take your TV tube and eat it. 'N all that phony stuff on sports. 'N all the unconfirmed reports. You know I watched that rotten box. Until my head began to hurt. From checkin' out the way. The newsmen say they get the dirt. Before the guys on channel so-and-so. And further they assert. That any show they'll interrupt. To bring you news if it comes up. They say that if the place blows up. They'll be the first to tell. Because the boys they got downtown. Are workin' hard and doin' swell<comma>. And if anybody gets the news. Before it hits the street<comma>. They say that no one blabs it faster. Their coverage can't be beat. . And if another woman driver. Gets machine-gunned from her seat. They'll send some joker with a brownie. And you'll see it all complete. . So I'm watchin' and I'm waitin'. Hopin' for the best. Even think I'll go to prayin'. Every time I hear 'em sayin'. That there's no way to delay. That trouble comin' every day. No way to delay. That trouble comin' every day. . Hey you know something people. I'm not black. But there's a whole lots a times. I wish I could say I'm not white. . Well<comma> I seen the fires burnin'. And the local people turnin'. On the merchants and the shops. Who used to sell their brooms and mops. And every other household item. Watched the mob just turn and bite 'em. And they say it served 'em right. Because a few of them are white<comma>. And it's the same across the nation. Black & white discrimination. They're yellin' ";You can't understand me!";. And all the other crap they hand me. In the papers and TV. 'N all that mass stupidity. That seems to grow more every day. Each time you hear some nitwit say. He wants to go and do you in. Because the color of your skin. Just don't appeal to him. (No matter if it's black or white). Because he's out for blood tonight. You know we gotta sit around at home. And watch this thing begin. But I bet there won't be many left. To see it really end. 'Cause the fire in the street. Ain't like the fire in my heart. And in the eyes of all these people. Don't you know that this could start. On any street in any town. In any state if any clown. Decides that now's the time to fight. For some ideal he thinks is right. And if a million more agree. There ain't no great society. As it applies to you and me. Our country isn't free. And the law refuses to see. If all that you can ever be. Is just a lousy janitor. Unless your uncle owns a store. You know that five in every four. Just one amount and nothin' more. Don't watch the rats go across the floor. And make up songs about being poor. Blow you harmonica son!

My body. So thin . So tired. Beaten for years. Ploughshare to bomb. So hard. . Bonebomb. Bonebomb. Bonebomb. . My town . So dusty. So dry. Buildings pushed over. Lives heat together. Young girls dreaming of beautiful deaths. Pop star pictures above their beds. Above their heads. Troops. . Everything stolen . Except my bones. Now I am only bone. I waited for peace. And here is my peace. Here in this still last minute of my life

Turning round burning.. . This balloon<comma> burning.

Spiders are singing in the salty breeze. Spiders are filling out tax returns. Spinning out webs of deductions and melodies. On a private beach in Michigan. . Why can't they wish their kisses good. Why do they miss when their kisses should . Fly like winging birds fighting for the keys . On a private beach in Michigan . . This recent rash of kidsmoke . All these telescopic poems. It's good to be alone . . Why can't they say what they want  . Why can't they just say what they mean . Come clean<comma> listen and talk . Hello private callers<comma> IDs blocked . . The sun will rise<comma> we'll climb into cars . The future has a valley and a shortcut around . Who will wear the crown of drowning award. Hold a private light on a Michigan shore . . You fool me with a kiss of kidsmoke. From a microscopic home . It's good to be alone . . I'll be in my bed . You can be the stone . That raises from the dead . And carries us all home  . . There's no blood on my hands . I just do as I am told
And you stare at me. In your Jesus Christ pose. Arms held out. Like you've been carrying a load. And you swear to me. You don't wanna be my slave. But you're staring at me. Like I....

But you're staring at me. Like I.... Like I'm driving the nails. . In your Jesus Christ pose. Arms held out. In your Jesus Christ pose. Thorns and shroud. Like it's the coming of the lord. Would it pay you more to walk on water. Than to wear a crown of thorns. It wouldn't pain me more to bury you rich. Than to bury you poor. . In your Jesus Christ pose

You say: "Ere long done do does did". Words which could only be your own. And then produce the text. From whence was ripped. 'Some dizzy whore'<comma> 1804. A dreaded sunny day. So let's go where we're happy. And I meet you at the cemetry gates. Oh Keats and Yeats are on your side. A dreaded sunny day. So let's go where we're wanted. And I meet you at the cemetry gates. Keats and Yeats are on your side. But you lose. 'Cause weird lover Wilde is on mine. (<i>sugar</i>)

In halted harmony. Brought down by an old idea whose time has come . And in the shadow of the valley of your family tree. There's a hundred hearts or three.

In the fresh air. Like an air balloon. Only with you. I just wanna be there with you. I just wanna be there with you. I just wanna be there with you<comma> Kay

A small Jean Genie snuck off to the city. Strung out on lasers and slash back blazers and. Ate all your razors while pulling the waiters. Talking 'bout Monroe and walking on Snow White. New York's a go-go and everything tastes nice. Poor little Greenie<comma> woohoo. . The Jean Genie lives on his back.

As she walks in the room<comma> scented and tall. Hesitating once more. And as I take on myself and the bitterness I felt. Realize that love flows. . Wild white horses<comma> they will take me away.

As someone sets light to the first fire of autumn. We settle down to cut ourselves apart. Cough and twitch from the news on your face. And some foreign candle burning in your eyes. . Held to the past<comma> too aware of the pending. Chill as the dawn breaks and finds us up for sale. Enter the fog<comma> another low road descending. Away from the cold lust<comma> your house<comma> and summertime. . Blind to the last cursed affair. Pistols and countless lies. A trail of white blood betrays. The reckless route your craft is running. . Feed 'til the sun turns into wood. Dousing an ancient torch. Loiter the whole day through. And lose yourself in lines dissecting love. . Your name on my cast and my notes on your stay. Offer me little but doting on a crime. We've turned every stone and for all our inventions. In matters of love lost<comma> we've no recourse at all. . Blind to the last cursed affair. Pistols and countless lies. A trail of white blood betrays. The reckless route your craft is running. . Feed 'til the sun turns into wood. Dousing an ancient torch. Loiter the whole day through. And lose yourself in lines dissecting love

As soon as I got on the horse I forgot about the math.. Forgot about the odds against an adolescent standing up to all of Owen's wrath.. The heat of prairie summer is impossible to take.. I grab the hem and lift the fabric over my sweet head.. I know what you're looking for and I'm never gonna give it to you.. I'm never gonna give it to you.. I'm never gonna give it to you.. . Government rule established by a dazzling light show.. A hegemony armored with a thousand-watt head and seven inches of echo.. I keep up my velocity my spurs are in her sides.. I don't know what I'm doing and it is the only way.. Toward the range I'll ride<comma> singing<comma> I'm never gonna give it to you.. I'm never gonna give it to you.. I'm never gonna give it to you.. . "I am overrated" said the sculptress to the sea.. "I've been praised for all the ways the marble leaves the man<comma>. And I was wrong to try and free him". And as for me I am a vector I am muscle I am bone.. The sun upon my shoulders and the horse between my legs<comma>. This is all I know.. . My senses are bedazzled by the parallax of the road.. I concentrate to keep contained the overflow.. My knuckles grip so tightly my fingers start to bleed.. If what I have is what you need<comma>. I'm never gonna give it to you.. I'm never gonna give it to you.. I'm never gonna give it to you.
As the descent began I got the distinct impression. Lake Michigan had been frozen for decades. I conducted the warmth from my metronome sternum. To our massive jetting vessel billowing plumes of spent fuel. . The tundra under us cracked and ruptured. To reveal palisades. Made of blades of gray<comma> gray bristling grass. And papulose lichen. I was so frightened. As my grip on you tightened. Your skin got slicker. . I am a deserted bus depot. Though our approach suggested. An American hazy sea. Like the one I found inside. After driving you home once. Still half high. . I-90 through utter desolation. I sense evil at the heart of each far flung well lighted home. I close my eyes and see cellar stairways. Vermiculated with delicate animal bone. . Musty rooms house racks of fur jackets. Spattered with plasma. On a bus in Indiana. I called you and screamed. Under ceaseless patterns of weeping light
As the light hits you<comma>. As you shift along the floor<comma>. I find it hard to place my face.. How did I come to be here<comma> anyway?. It's terribly vague<comma> what's gone before.. . I could have been anyone.. You could have been anyone's dream.. . (dreamer). . Why did you have to choose our moment?. Why did you have to make me feel that?. Why did you make it so unreal?. . . Oh! To be in love<comma>. And never get out again.. Oh! To be in love<comma>. And never get out again.. Oh! To be in love<comma>. Never get out again.. . Oh! To be in love<comma>. And never get out again.. Oh! To be in love<comma>. And never get out again.. Oh! To be in love<comma>. Never get out again.. . . All the colours look brighter now.. Everything they say seems to sound new.. Slipping into tomorrow too quick<comma>. Yesterday always too good to forget.. Stop the swing of the pendulum. Let us through!. . . Oh! To be in love<comma>. And never get out again.. Oh! To be in love<comma>. And never get out again.. Oh! To be in love<comma>. Never get out again.

A strange form of life kicking through windows<comma> rolling on yards. Heading in loved ones<comma> triggering odds. A strange one. . And a hard way to come into a cabin<comma> into the weather. Into a path walking together. A hard one. . And the softest lips ever<comma> twenty-five years of waiting to kiss them. Smiling and waiting to bend down and kiss twice. The softest lips. . And a dark little room across the nation<comma> you found myself racing. Forgetting the strange and the hard and the soft kiss. In the dark room. . And a strange form of life kicking through windows<comma> rolling on yards. Heading in loved ones<comma> triggering odds. A strange one

At least I won't be shot for singing. I'm a free agent – I can protest. This must be freedom. I must be happy!. So let Mandela rot in prison. Someone should tell him how lucky he is.

at night we crossed the border following a Black robe. to the edge of the reservation—to Cataldo Mission. where the saints and all the martyrs look down on dying converts. <i>what makes the water holy</i> she says <i>is that that it's the closest thing to rain</i>. . I stole the mule from Anthony—I helped Anne up upon it. and we rode to Coeur d'Alene—passed Harrison and Wallace. they were blasting out the tunnels—making way for the light of learning. <i>when Jesus comes a'calling</i> she said <i>he's coming round the mountain on a train</i>. .

Baby canteen<comma> when i thought your heart stopped beating. The room brought out the silence in your breathing. A birth in wooded housing will help you live beyond the numbers. Let us pray to pan let in the light. And see us bathe and sleep among us. Smell the body of our elders. And wake up to the milky way at breakfast. I'll take the time to pick up all the widow makers broken . No real way to remember if we'll work again. . Color people say oh no<comma> cause they think it's contagious. Marshmallow people say oh yeah<comma> cause they think it's a masterpiece. . The sky has brakes . What a good day to rise. De Soto De Son will time. . Goodbye blue heron goodbye green fly goodbye goodbye. . I've got a raft you'll sail till the open lie in the lake. While your body is broken . When you go out I'll cry in the thicket. Shooting from school. There's a green where the crickets cry mom can't breathe and i know she's leaving. And that the birds of a quay are all good for the crocodile. So slow it down. Its not a race. Death takes time. Do you see it?. . Baby canteen swollen fingers in the water . I roped an Island pony for your birthday. I'll live in wooded housing till they put out all your needles. And drop you in and shelter near the highway

Baby<comma> I've been waiting. I've been waiting night and day. I didn't see the time. I waited half my life away. There were lots of invitations. And I know you sent me some. But I was waiting. For the miracle<comma> for the miracle to come. . I know you really loved me. But you see my hands were tied. I know it must have hurt you. It must have hurt your pride. To have to stand beneath my window. With your bugle and your drum. And me I'm up there waiting. For the miracle<comma> for the miracle to come. . Ah I don't believe you'd like it. You wouldn't like it here. There ain't no entertainment. And the judgments are severe. The maestro says it's Mozart. But it sounds like bubble gum. When you're waiting. For the miracle<comma> for the miracle to come. . Waiting for the miracle. There's nothing left to do. I haven't been this happy. Since the end of World War II. . Nothing left to do. When you know that you've been taken. Nothing left to do. When you're begging for a crumb. Nothing left to do. When you've got to go on waiting. Waiting for the miracle to come. . I dreamed about you<comma> baby. It was just the other night. Most of you was naked. Ah but some of you was light. The sands of time were falling. From your fingers and your thumb. And you were waiting. For the miracle<comma> for the miracle to come. . Ah<comma> baby<comma> let's get married. We've been alone too long. Let's be alone together. Let's see if we're that strong. Yeah let's do something crazy. Something absolutely wrong. While we're waiting. For the miracle<comma> for the miracle to come. . When you've fallen on the highway. And you're lying in the rain. And they ask you how you're doing. Of course you'll say you can't complain. If you're squeezed for information. That's when you've got to play it dumb. You just say you're out there waiting. For the miracle<comma> for the miracle to come

Baby's into running around. Hanging with the crowd. Putting your business in the street talking out loud. Saying you bought her this and that. And how much you done spent. I swear she must believe it's all heaven sent. Hey boy you better bring the chick around. To the sad. sad truth the dirty lowdown. . (Who I wonder who) taught her how to talk like that. (Who I wonder who) gave her that big idea. . Nothing you can't handle nothing you ain't got. Put the money on the table and drive it off the lot. Turn on that ole lovelight and turn a maybe to a yes. Same old schoolboy game got you into this mess. Hey son better get back to town. Face the sad old truth the dirty lowdown. . (Who I wonder who) put those ideas in your head. (Who I wonder who) yeah. Come on back down little son. Dig the low low low low lowdown. . You ain't got to be so bad got to be so cold. This dog eat dog existence sure is getting old.

(Who I wonder who ohh ohh). Got you thinking like that
Baby's on fire. Better throw her in the water. Look at her laughing. Like a heifer to the slaughter. . Baby's on fire. And all the laughing boys are bitching. Waiting for photos. Oh the plot is so bewitching. . Rescuers row row. Do your best to change the subject. Blow the wind blow blow. Lend some assistance to the object. . Photographers snip snap. Take your time she's only burning. This kind of experience. Is necessary for her learning. . If you'll be my flotsam. I could be half the man I used to. They said you were hot stuff. And that's what baby's been reduced to. . Juanita and Juan. Very clever with maracas. Making their fortunes. Selling secondhand tobaccoes. . Juan dances at Chico's. And when the clients are evicted. He empties the ashtrays. And pockets all that he's collected. . But baby's on fire. And all the instruments agree that. Her temperature's rising. But any idiot would know that

Bailey's her name and there's a price she takes. . Blurring lines while she ruthlessly raised the stakes. . And there's a mess that she made. . We kiss on the mouth with hearts that were bound and gagged. . The news was broke the witness was the Cascades. . Do you remember me? . 'Cause there's a piece of my mind in a field of dandelions. . Do you remember me? 'Cause there's a tale I tell. . It's made of rain and hell. . We will seldom speak<comma> and we will rarely talk. . Bailey<comma> your secret's known. . She weeps in the brush alone. . Loss wed to despair<comma> in love when her womb was bare. . We kiss on the mouth with hearts that were bound and gagged. . The news was broke the witness was the Cascades. . A kiss<comma> a touch<comma> our bodies became arsonists to will and brains. . To him the cold hearted thing was she came demanding rings. . The day was mute and hot. We will rarely talk. . I'm just where you left me alone by them lilacs.

Basking in low gravity<comma> in a fog.. Wilting in your levity.. Whitewashing avenues of our widening disparities.. We never made a sound just stared at one another.. . The heavy clouds that crowd your head<comma> and above<comma>. Satellites that light the dead darkness of your vacuum.. Your body bleeds in infrared.. . The shadow and the flame run from another.. The river calm and tame sits above the undercurrents.. . Relish in the sound.. The weightless words the heart attracts.. I want it all; no<comma> I want you back; the period a long ellipse.. You can lose the weight but it all comes back
Bass in your face. Not an eight track. Gettin' it good to the wood. So the people. Give you some a dat. Reactin' to the fax. That I kick and it stick. And it stay around. Pointin' to the joint<comma> put the Buddha down. Goin'<comma> goin'<comma> gettin' to the roots. Ain't givin' it up. So turn me loose. But then again I got a story. That's harder than the hardcore. Cost of the holocaust. I'm talin' 'bout the one still goin' on. I know. Where I'm from<comma> not dum diddie dum. From the base motherland. The place of the drum. Invaded by the wack diddie wack. Fooled the black<comma> left us faded. King and chief probably had a big beef. Because of dat now I grit my teeth. So here's a song to the strong. 'Bout a shake of a snake. And the smile went along wit dat. Can't truss it. Kickin' wicked rhymes. Like a fortune teller. 'Cause the wickedness done by Jack. Where everybody at. Divided and sold. For liquor and the gold. Smacked in the back. For the other man to mack. Now the story that I'm kickin' is gory. Little Rock where they be. Dockin' this boat. No hope I'm shackled. Plus gang tackled. By the other hand swingin' the rope. Wearin' red<comma> white and blue Jack and his crew. The guy's authorized beat down for the brown. Man to the man<comma> each one so it teach one. Born to terrorize sisters and every brother. One love who said it. I know Whodini sang it. But the hater taught hate. That's why we gang bang it. Beware of the hand. When it's comin' from the left. I ain't trippin' just watch ya step. Can't truss it. An I judge everyone<comma> one by the one. Look here come the judge. Watch it here he come now. I can only guess what's happ'nin'. Years ago he woulda been. The ships captain. Gettin' me bruised on a cruise. What I got to lose<comma> lost all contact. Got me layin' on my back. Rollin' in my own leftover. When I roll over<comma> I roll over in somebody else's. 90 F--kin' days on a slave ship. Count 'em fallin' off 2<comma> 3<comma> 4 hun'ed at a time. Blood in the wood and it's mine. I'm chokin' on spit feelin' pain. Like my brain bein' chained. Still gotta give it what I got. But it's hot in the day<comma> cold in the night. But I thrive to survive<comma> I pray to god to stay alive. Attitude boils up inside. And that ain't it (think I'll every quit). Still I pray to get my hands 'round. The neck of the man wit' the whip. 3 months pass<comma> they brand a label on my ass. To signify. Owned. I'm on the microphone. Sayin' 1555. How I'm livin'. We been livin' here. Livin' ain't the word. I been givin'. Haven't got. Classify us in the have-nots. Fightin' haves. 'Cause it's all about money. When it comes to Armageddon. Mean I'm getting mine. Here I am turn it over Sam. 427 to the year. Do you understand. That's why it's hard. For the black to love the land. Once again. Bass in your face. Not an eight track. Gettin' it good to the wood. So the people. Give you some a dat. Reactin' to the fax. That I kick and it stick. And it stay around. Pointin' to the joint<comma> put the Buddha down. Goin'<comma> goin'<comma> gettin' to the roots. Ain't givin' it up. So turn me loose. But then again I got a story. That's harder than the hardcore. Cost of the holocaust.

Before the world you know was like it is. I held a lover once and I was his. And we walked along the river in the sun. But he's a lonely man<comma> so this was done. The only place we had to meet was night. While the sun he sleeps in shadows we can hide. On the mountainside we spent our time together. But it is gone when morning comes. . And you are the wolf . And I am the moon. And in the endless sky we are but one. We are alive. In my dreams wolf and I. . How many days and nights will come and go. While the only light you'll see is from my glow. There will never be a dawn that breaks the spell surrounding us. . Til the earth dies with the sun. . And you are the wolf . And I am the moon. And in the endless sky we are but one. We are alive. In my dreams wolf and I. (Repeat). . Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh (4x). Aaah aaah aaah aaaah aaah (2x). . In the endless sky we are but one. Hmmmm mmm

They are lost in the dark woods of time. . Aloft in the landscape that you hail. I am the fog that seeps over here in the early hours. . Standing proud in the hollow of the land. A vestige of deeper purity etched in spirit agaisnt the sky. . The menhir had runes carved in limbs of oaken sovereignty. and could see the ages growing from within the palms. I can feel the era slipping into oblivion<comma>. no longer grasping the textures. I am slowly becoming stone. . As wolves celebrate the dusk<comma>. an old voice of wisdom haunts the vale. . Shapes flicker in the fire light through the windows. The woodlands burn with grace. Their silence drowns the age. . As wandering ghosts pass through the flames. A new age of rebirth lights the dawn. . But who are they who pass by the window?. The shapes; like black solar wheels scorched in the snow. by gods of the stone.... This elder stone shall never fall!. . Cast the aeons into the void. So that no other can seek them. No age<comma> no hands shall taint them. Pour the sorrows into the sun. They are lost forever in dark woods of time. Carve the symbols into the stone. So that another can find them. No age<comma> no hands shall change them. Pour the ages into the sun. They are lost forever in the dark woods of time

(by The White Stripes). . I'm gonna fight 'em off. A seven nation army couldn't hold me back. They're gonna rip it off. Taking their time right behind my back. And I'm talkin' to myself at night. Because I can't forget. Back and forth through my mind. Behind a cigarette. . And the message comin' from my eyes says leave it alone.... . Don't wanna hear about it. Every single one's got a story to tell. Everyone knows about it. From the Queen of England to the hounds of hell. And if I catch it comin' back my way. I'm gonna serve it to you. And that ain't what you want to hear. But that's what I'll do. . And the feeling coming from my bones says find a home.... . I'm going to Wichita. Far from this opera forevermore. I'm gonna work the straw. Make the sweat drip out of every pore. And I'm bleeding<comma> and I'm bleeding<comma> and I'm bleeding. Right before the lord. All the words are gonna bleed from me. And I will think no more. . And the stains comin' from my blood tell me "Go back home"...

By townes van zandt. . If I had a dollar bill. Yes<comma> I believe I surely will. Go to town and drink my fill. Early in the morning. . Little darling<comma> she's a redhaired thing. Man<comma> she makes my legs to sing. Gonna buy her a diamond ring. Early in the morning. . Mother was a golden girl. I slit her throat just to get her pearls. Cast myself into a whirl. Before a bunch of swine. . It's a long way down the harlan road. . . Busted back and a heavy load. Won't get through to save my soul. Early in the morning. . I've always been a gambling man. I've roled them bones with either hand. Seven is the promised land. Early in the morning. . Whiskey'd be my dying bed. Tell me where to lay my head. Not with me is all she said.

By townes van zandt. . If I had no place to fall. And I needed to. Could I count on you. To lay me down? . . I'd never tell you no lies. I don't believe it's wise. You got pretty eyes. Won't you spin me 'round. . I ain't much of a lover it's true. I'm here then I'm gone. And I'm forever blue. But I'm sure wanting you. . Skies full of silver and gold. . . Try to hide the sun.

She's here then she's gone. And she won't come again. Won't you take my hand. . If I had no place to fall. And I needed to. Could I count on you. To lay me down?
By townes van zandt. . If I needed you. Would you come to me<comma>. Would you come to me<comma>. And ease my pain? . If you needed me. I would come to you. I'd swim the seas.

The lady's with me now. Since I showed her how. To lay her lily. Hand in mine. Loop and Lil agree. She's a sight to see. And a treasure for. The poor to find
By townes van zandt. . I heard her sing in tongues of silver. I heard her cry on a summer storm. I loved her<comma> but she did not know it. So I don't think about her anymore.

Called to see. If your back was still aligned. And your sheets. Were growing grass all on the corners of your bed. . But you've got too much to wear on your sleeves. That has too much to do with me. And secretly<comma> I want to bury in the yard. The gray remains of a friendship scarred. . You told us of your new life there. You've got someone coming round. Gluing tinsel to your crown. He's got you talking pretty loud. . You berate<comma> remember your ailing heart and your criminal eyes. You say you're still in love. If it's true<comma> what can be done?. It's hard to leave all these moments behind. . Called to see. If your back was still aligned. And your sheets. Were growing grass all on the corners of your bed. . But you've got too much to wear on your sleeves. That has too much to do with me. And secretly<comma> I want to bury in the yard. The gray remains of a friendship scarred. . You tested your mettle.

Stay out of my nightmares<comma> stay out of my dreams. You're not even welcome in my memories. When things are alright and I want what I've got. It's only momentarily thought. . Fade out<comma> fade out. Fade out<comma> fade out. Fade out<comma> fade out. Fade out<comma> fade out. . If no one thinks of no one. Then no one believes in no one. And no one fucks with no one.
