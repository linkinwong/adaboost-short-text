I know you are waiting and I know that it is not for me. But I'm here and I'm ready and I've saved you the passenger seat. I won't be your last dance just your last goodnight. Every heart is a package tangled up in knots someone else tied. I'll be the one to drive you back home Kathleen. . So crawl up your trellis and quietly back into your room. And I'll coast down the length of your drive by the light of the moon. And the next time I see you - a new kind of hello. Both our hearts have a secret only both of us know. 'Bout the night that I drove you back home Kathleen,energetic.
All the other girls here are stars - you are the northern lights. They try to shine in through your curtains - you're too close and too bright. They try and they try but everything that they do. Is the ghost of a trace of a pale imitation of you. I'll be the one to drive you back home Kathleen. . This party was made with the night air and the chance that a smile. Will wind its way from your face to one of the boys in your line. You act like you're hip to their tricks and you're strong. But a virgin Wurlitzer heart never once had a song. I'll be the one to drive you back home Kathleen. . And I'll have you back by break of day. I'm going your way anyway. And if you'd like to come along. I'll be yours for a song. . I know you are waiting and I know that it is not for me. But I'm here and I'm ready and I've saved you the passenger seat. I won't be your last dance just your last goodnight.

All there years you've been speaking without breathing. Spinning closer to the sun. Had your way with an unsuspecting public. Little threads are all it takes. La la la la .... I have learned all your secrets so familiar. I know where you lay your head. Fear of god and a disappointing father. Holds the hand around your neck. La la la la .... Sometimes I could just choke myself with laughter. Sometimes everything's so true. So when you come down from your death-defying labors. I'll still be in love with you. La la la la ...,calm.

A long stone and my day's all serpentine. The tired tarnish in my chest rests sense of SARS. And one dull dawn where they hum that splits its length. Does my name sting your tongue?  Now does it beg?. . Your thin frame has set my eyes to fray. On our dim stretch of this street how it aches. For every grey and sad and taut to coil. And our frail eyes and there watch to finally talk. . One brash phrase cut crush these fragile days. My thoughts swirl in some shrill sad cannonade. And one such spur that caused my throat to creak. The one dull dawn that I've since sensed to repeat,calm.
A long time you waited. You thought it had abated. Shame of it all. The harm that it causes. Pours down like a faucet. Shame of it all,calm.

Andalucia when can I see you. When it is snowing out again. Farmer John wants you. Louder and softer closer and nearer. Then again. Needing you taking you keeping you leaving you. In a year and a day to be sure. That your face doesn't alter. Your words never falter -- I love you. . I'll be here waiting later and later. Hoping the night will go away. Andalucia Castles and Christians. Andalucia come to stay. You were lost on a day much like this. When you'd made up your mind not to come. And I couldn't persuade you. Or wait till tomorrow -- or pass the time,sad.

at night we crossed the border following a Black robe. to the edge of the reservation—to Cataldo Mission. where the saints and all the martyrs look down on dying converts. . . Yeah. It's my home—last night I dreamt that I grew wings. I found a place where they could hear me when I sing.. . and so they came with cameras—breaking through the morning mist. press and businessmen—tycoons—Episcopal philanthropists. lost in their appraisal of the body of a woman. but all we saw were lowlands—clouds clung to mountains without strings. . and at last we saw some people... . at last we saw some people.... at last we saw some people huddled up against. the rain that was descending like railroad spikes and hammers. they were headed for the border—walking and then running. and then they were gone into the fog but Anne said underneath their jackets she saw wings,calm.

A tornado flew around my room before you came. Excuse the mess it made oooh),lonely.
A touch too much okay. Cause I will stay with you,energetic.
At the starting of the week. At summit talks you'll hear them speak. It's only Monday. Negotiations breaking down. See those leaders start to frown. It's sword and gun day. . Tomorrow never comes until it's too late. . You could be sitting taking lunch. The news will hit you like a punch. It's only Tuesday. You never thought we'd go to war. After all the things we saw. It's April Fools day. . Tomorrow never comes until it's too late. . We'll all go running underground. And we'll be listening for the sound. It's only Wednesday. In your shelter dimly lit. Take some wool and learn to knit. Cause it's a long day. . Tomorrow never comes until it's too late. . You hear a whistling overhead. Are you alive or are you dead?. It's only Thursday. You feel a shaking on the ground. A billion candles burn around. Is it your birthday?. . Tomorrow never comes until it's too late. . Although that shelter is your home. A living space you have outgrown. It's only Friday. As you come out to the light. Can your eyes behold the sight?. It must be doomsday. . Tomorrow never comes until it's too late. . Ain't it funny how men think. They made the bomb they are extinct. It's only Saturday. . I think tomorrow's come I think it's too late. I think tomorrow's come I think it's too late. Think tomorrow's come I think it's too late,sad.
At times I see you you silver rider. Sometimes your voice is not enough. Your face in windows outside forever. Nobody dreamed you'd save the world. Nobody dreamed you'd save the world. . Your march is over. The great destroyer. She passes through you like a knife. Oh take me with you. You silver rider. Sometimes your voice is not enough. Sometimes your voice is not enough,sad.

Baby canteen cause they think it's a masterpiece. . The sky has brakes . What a good day to rise. De Soto De Son will time. . Goodbye blue heron goodbye green fly goodbye goodbye. . I've got a raft you'll sail till the open lie in the lake. While your body is broken . When you go out I'll cry in the thicket. Shooting from school. There's a green where the crickets cry mom can't breathe and i know she's leaving. And that the birds of a quay are all good for the crocodile. So slow it down. Its not a race. Death takes time. Do you see it?. . Baby canteen swollen fingers in the water . I roped an Island pony for your birthday. I'll live in wooded housing till they put out all your needles. And drop you in and shelter near the highway,calm.
Baby for the miracle to come,sad.

Do you remember me? 'Cause there's a tale I tell. . It's made of rain and hell. . We will seldom speak our bodies became arsonists to will and brains. . To him the cold hearted thing was she came demanding rings. . The day was mute and hot. We will rarely talk. . I'm just where you left me alone by them lilacs.,lonely.

Ce petit cœur qui ne bat pour personne.  Ce petit cœur qui ne bat que pour lui.  A peine si ce petit cœur se donne.  Car vas tu changer ma vie.  . Oh oh oh oh oh.  Oh oh oh oh.  . Ce petit cœur ennuyeux monotone.  Qui ne sait rien faire que pleurer sur lui.  Tout juste si ce petit cœur frissonne.  Lorsque le mien lui sourit.  . Oh oh oh oh oh.  Oh oh oh oh.  . Peut être qu'un jour il souffrira.  Mais ce ne sera pas pour moi.  Et ce jour là il m'oubliera.  Ce petit cœur que je n'oublierai pas.  . Peut être qu'un jour il souffrira.  Mais ce ne sera pas pour moi.  Et ce jour là il m'oubliera.  Ce petit cœur que je n'oublierai pas.  . Ce petit cœur qui passe tout son temps.  A s'écouter et à se regarder.  Ce petit cœur à qui il plaît tant.  De se savoir très aimé.  . Ce petit cœur c'est bien lui pourtant.  Dont le mien ne peut se passer.  Oui ce petit cœur c'est bien lui pourtant.  Dont le mien ne peut se passer,happy.

Chico Fernandez . Livin' on a gun. Dreams of Santa Anna. Fighting in the sun. Drums so loud from outside. Makes it hard to dream. A rain is fallin' hard and fast. Makes it all seem real . Mornin' come mornin. A Chico's gotta have his share. Mornin' sad mornin'. What a laugh and out loud. Ha ha ha ha ha,energetic.
