All the other girls here are stars - you are the northern lights. They try to shine in through your curtains - you're too close and too bright. They try and they try but everything that they do. Is the ghost of a trace of a pale imitation of you. I'll be the one to drive you back home Kathleen. . This party was made with the night air and the chance that a smile. Will wind its way from your face to one of the boys in your line. You act like you're hip to their tricks and you're strong. But a virgin Wurlitzer heart never once had a song. I'll be the one to drive you back home Kathleen. . And I'll have you back by break of day. I'm going your way anyway. And if you'd like to come along. I'll be yours for a song. . I know you are waiting and I know that it is not for me. But I'm here and I'm ready and I've saved you the passenger seat. I won't be your last dance just your last goodnight. Every heart is a package tangled up in knots someone else tied. I'll be the one to drive you back home Kathleen. . So crawl up your trellis and quietly back into your room. And I'll coast down the length of your drive by the light of the moon. And the next time I see you - a new kind of hello. Both our hearts have a secret only both of us know. 'Bout the night that I drove you back home Kathleen
All there years you've been speaking without breathing. Spinning closer to the sun. Had your way with an unsuspecting public. Little threads are all it takes. La la la la .... I have learned all your secrets<comma> so familiar. I know where you lay your head. Fear of god and a disappointing father. Holds the hand around your neck. La la la la .... Sometimes I could just choke myself with laughter. Sometimes everything's so true. So when you come down from your death-defying labors. I'll still be in love with you. La la la la ...

A man made of butterfat. Careening around on a Sno-Cat. And I can't drive any faster. My hands are like ice and the moon shines. On pepper trees and road grease. The yellow lines look blue . . Snow covers Whitehall. White powdered Nembutal. And I can't think any more. My feet are like ice. And the moon sets. On Christmas trees and plastic deer . . I decided to forgive and forget. I thank god you're comatose. As I pull back the bedclothes. And I can't believe my composure. And I can't remember my anger. And summer is a fish story. I wonder where we'll be

As someone sets light to the first fire of autumn. We settle down to cut ourselves apart. Cough and twitch from the news on your face. And some foreign candle burning in your eyes. .

As soon as I got on the horse I forgot about the math.. Forgot about the odds against an adolescent standing up to all of Owen's wrath.. The heat of prairie summer is impossible to take.. I grab the hem and lift the fabric over my sweet head.. I know what you're looking for and I'm never gonna give it to you.. I'm never gonna give it to you.. I'm never gonna give it to you.. . Government rule established by a dazzling light show.. A hegemony armored with a thousand-watt head and seven inches of echo.. I keep up my velocity my spurs are in her sides.. I don't know what I'm doing and it is the only way.. Toward the range I'll ride<comma> singing<comma> I'm never gonna give it to you.. I'm never gonna give it to you.. I'm never gonna give it to you.. . "I am overrated" said the sculptress to the sea.. "I've been praised for all the ways the marble leaves the man<comma>. And I was wrong to try and free him". And as for me I am a vector I am muscle I am bone.. The sun upon my shoulders and the horse between my legs<comma>. This is all I know.. . My senses are bedazzled by the parallax of the road.. I concentrate to keep contained the overflow.. My knuckles grip so tightly my fingers start to bleed.. If what I have is what you need<comma>. I'm never gonna give it to you.. I'm never gonna give it to you.. I'm never gonna give it to you.
As the descent began I got the distinct impression. Lake Michigan had been frozen for decades. I conducted the warmth from my metronome sternum. To our massive jetting vessel billowing plumes of spent fuel. . The tundra under us cracked and ruptured. To reveal palisades. Made of blades of gray<comma> gray bristling grass. And papulose lichen. I was so frightened. As my grip on you tightened. Your skin got slicker. . I am a deserted bus depot. Though our approach suggested. An American hazy sea. Like the one I found inside. After driving you home once. Still half high. . I-90 through utter desolation. I sense evil at the heart of each far flung well lighted home. I close my eyes and see cellar stairways. Vermiculated with delicate animal bone. . Musty rooms house racks of fur jackets. Spattered with plasma. On a bus in Indiana. I called you and screamed. Under ceaseless patterns of weeping light
As the light hits you<comma>. As you shift along the floor<comma>. I find it hard to place my face.. How did I come to be here<comma> anyway?. It's terribly vague<comma> what's gone before.. . I could have been anyone.. You could have been anyone's dream.. . (dreamer). . Why did you have to choose our moment?. Why did you have to make me feel that?. Why did you make it so unreal?. . . Oh! To be in love<comma>. And never get out again.. Oh! To be in love<comma>. And never get out again.. Oh! To be in love<comma>. Never get out again.. . Oh! To be in love<comma>. And never get out again.. Oh! To be in love<comma>. And never get out again.. Oh! To be in love<comma>. Never get out again.. . . All the colours look brighter now.. Everything they say seems to sound new.. Slipping into tomorrow too quick<comma>. Yesterday always too good to forget.. Stop the swing of the pendulum. Let us through!. . . Oh! To be in love<comma>. And never get out again.. Oh! To be in love<comma>. And never get out again.. Oh! To be in love<comma>. Never get out again.
As the spring is made alive the winter dies. And the final cries of creatures are long behind. And full of spirit the village starts again. With one more year for a man to change his ways. . I used to feel all things around me stir. Grateful for all I received. Taking in the sounds and ways of creatures upon the earth. Great were the rivers I swam waiting out the sun. . As the winter dies the earth is brought to life. And a thousand merchant ships sail to find. A worthy village to land and start again. With one more year for a man to change his ways. . I used to feel all things around me stir. Grateful for all I received. Taking in the sounds and ways of creatures upon the earth. Great were the rivers I swam waiting out the sun. . I used to feel all things around me stir. I’d hear the sound of creatures upon the earth. Grateful for all I received. Though winter cold and spring

A strange form of life kicking through windows<comma> rolling on yards. Heading in loved ones<comma> triggering odds. A strange one. . And a hard way to come into a cabin<comma> into the weather. Into a path walking together. A hard one. . And the softest lips ever<comma> twenty-five years of waiting to kiss them. Smiling and waiting to bend down and kiss twice. The softest lips. .

And a strange form of life kicking through windows<comma> rolling on yards. Heading in loved ones<comma> triggering odds. A strange one
As we fall into sequence. And we're eating our young. Remain silent and still for modesty. . When the splints have been broken. And they can't help you now. Do you pray with your eyes closed naturally. . Follow me to nowhere. Woven with the utmost care. . If I'm lost please don't find me. If I drown let me sink. We descended from no one. With a wink. . When it's cold outside hold me. Don't hold me. When I choose to rest my eyes coax me. Don't coax me. When it's cold outside hold me. Don't hold me. When I choose to rest my eyes coax me. Don't coax me. . Follow me to nowhere. Woven with the utmost care. . Have they cleansed you with chloride. And scrubbed behind the knees. Has your body been hollowed by the breeze

at night we crossed the border following a Black robe. to the edge of the reservation—to Cataldo Mission. where the saints and all the martyrs look down on dying converts. <i>what makes the water holy</i> she says <i>is that that it's the closest thing to rain</i>. . I stole the mule from Anthony—I helped Anne up upon it. and we rode to Coeur d'Alene—passed Harrison and Wallace. they were blasting out the tunnels—making way for the light of learning. <i>when Jesus comes a'calling</i> she said <i>he's coming round the mountain on a train</i>. . Yeah. It's my home—last night I dreamt that I grew wings. I found a place where they could hear me when I sing. . we floated on to Hanford in a lumber boat up river. past the fisheries and the mill towns like a stretch of future graveyards. she was driven to distraction—said <i>I wonder what will happen. when they find out they're mistaken—the land is too changed to ever change</i>. . we waded through the marketplace—someone's ship had come in. there was silver and begonias—dynamite and cattle. there were hearts as big as apples and apples in the shape of Mary's heart.

Death takes time. Do you see it?. . Baby canteen swollen fingers in the water . I roped an Island pony for your birthday. I'll live in wooded housing till they put out all your needles. And drop you in and shelter near the highway

Got to have a Jones for this Jones for that. This running with the Joneses boy. Just ain't where it's at. You gonna come back around. To the sad sad truth the dirty lowdown. . (Who I wonder who) got you thinking like that boy. (Who I wonder who). (Who I wonder who said who I wonder who). Oh look out for that lowdown. That dirty dirty dirty dirty lowdown. (Who I wonder who ohh ohh). Got you thinking like that
Baby's on fire. Better throw her in the water. Look at her laughing. Like a heifer to the slaughter. . Baby's on fire. And all the laughing boys are bitching. Waiting for photos. Oh the plot is so bewitching. . Rescuers row row. Do your best to change the subject. Blow the wind blow blow. Lend some assistance to the object. . Photographers snip snap. Take your time she's only burning. This kind of experience. Is necessary for her learning. . If you'll be my flotsam. I could be half the man I used to. They said you were hot stuff. And that's what baby's been reduced to. . Juanita and Juan. Very clever with maracas. Making their fortunes. Selling secondhand tobaccoes. . Juan dances at Chico's. And when the clients are evicted. He empties the ashtrays. And pockets all that he's collected. . But baby's on fire. And all the instruments agree that. Her temperature's rising. But any idiot would know that

Bailey's her name and there's a price she takes. . Blurring lines while she ruthlessly raised the stakes. . And there's a mess that she made. . We kiss on the mouth with hearts that were bound and gagged. . The news was broke the witness was the Cascades. . Do you remember me? . 'Cause there's a piece of my mind in a field of dandelions. . Do you remember me? 'Cause there's a tale I tell. . It's made of rain and hell. . We will seldom speak<comma> and we will rarely talk. . Bailey<comma> your secret's known. . She weeps in the brush alone. . Loss wed to despair<comma> in love when her womb was bare. . We kiss on the mouth with hearts that were bound and gagged. . The news was broke the witness was the Cascades. . A kiss<comma> a touch<comma> our bodies became arsonists to will and brains. . To him the cold hearted thing was she came demanding rings. . The day was mute and hot. We will rarely talk. . I'm just where you left me alone by them lilacs.

Basking in low gravity<comma> in a fog.. Wilting in your levity.. Whitewashing avenues of our widening disparities.. We never made a sound just stared at one another.. . The heavy clouds that crowd your head<comma> and above<comma>. Satellites that light the dead darkness of your vacuum.. Your body bleeds in infrared.. . The shadow and the flame run from another.. The river calm and tame sits above the undercurrents.. . Relish in the sound.. The weightless words the heart attracts.. I want it all; no<comma> I want you back; the period a long ellipse.. You can lose the weight but it all comes back
Bass in your face. Not an eight track. Gettin' it good to the wood. So the people. Give you some a dat. Reactin' to the fax. That I kick and it stick. And it stay around. Pointin' to the joint<comma> put the Buddha down. Goin'<comma> goin'<comma> gettin' to the roots. Ain't givin' it up. So turn me loose. But then again I got a story. That's harder than the hardcore. Cost of the holocaust. I'm talin' 'bout the one still goin' on. I know. Where I'm from<comma> not dum diddie dum. From the base motherland. The place of the drum. Invaded by the wack diddie wack. Fooled the black<comma> left us faded. King and chief probably had a big beef. Because of dat now I grit my teeth. So here's a song to the strong. 'Bout a shake of a snake. And the smile went along wit dat. Can't truss it. Kickin' wicked rhymes. Like a fortune teller. 'Cause the wickedness done by Jack. Where everybody at. Divided and sold. For liquor and the gold. Smacked in the back. For the other man to mack. Now the story that I'm kickin' is gory. Little Rock where they be. Dockin' this boat. No hope I'm shackled. Plus gang tackled. By the other hand swingin' the rope. Wearin' red<comma> white and blue Jack and his crew. The guy's authorized beat down for the brown. Man to the man<comma> each one so it teach one. Born to terrorize sisters and every brother. One love who said it. I know Whodini sang it. But the hater taught hate. That's why we gang bang it. Beware of the hand. When it's comin' from the left. I ain't trippin' just watch ya step. Can't truss it. An I judge everyone<comma> one by the one. Look here come the judge. Watch it here he come now. I can only guess what's happ'nin'. Years ago he woulda been. The ships captain. Gettin' me bruised on a cruise. What I got to lose<comma> lost all contact. Got me layin' on my back. Rollin' in my own leftover. When I roll over<comma> I roll over in somebody else's. 90 F--kin' days on a slave ship. Count 'em fallin' off 2<comma> 3<comma> 4 hun'ed at a time. Blood in the wood and it's mine. I'm chokin' on spit feelin' pain. Like my brain bein' chained. Still gotta give it what I got. But it's hot in the day<comma> cold in the night. But I thrive to survive<comma> I pray to god to stay alive. Attitude boils up inside. And that ain't it (think I'll every quit). Still I pray to get my hands 'round. The neck of the man wit' the whip. 3 months pass<comma> they brand a label on my ass. To signify. Owned. I'm on the microphone. Sayin' 1555. How I'm livin'. We been livin' here. Livin' ain't the word. I been givin'. Haven't got. Classify us in the have-nots. Fightin' haves. 'Cause it's all about money. When it comes to Armageddon. Mean I'm getting mine. Here I am turn it over Sam. 427 to the year. Do you understand. That's why it's hard. For the black to love the land. Once again. Bass in your face. Not an eight track. Gettin' it good to the wood. So the people. Give you some a dat. Reactin' to the fax. That I kick and it stick. And it stay around. Pointin' to the joint<comma> put the Buddha down. Goin'<comma> goin'<comma> gettin' to the roots. Ain't givin' it up. So turn me loose. But then again I got a story. That's harder than the hardcore. Cost of the holocaust.

We are richer in love<comma> but you know: You just can't have it.

They say everybody steals somebody's heart away . And I've been wondering why you let me down . And I been taking it all for granted

Before the world you know was like it is. I held a lover once and I was his. And we walked along the river in the sun. But he's a lonely man<comma> so this was done. The only place we had to meet was night. While the sun he sleeps in shadows we can hide. On the mountainside we spent our time together. But it is gone when morning comes. . And you are the wolf . And I am the moon. And in the endless sky we are but one. We are alive. In my dreams wolf and I. . How many days and nights will come and go. While the only light you'll see is from my glow. There will never be a dawn that breaks the spell surrounding us. . Til the earth dies with the sun. . And you are the wolf . And I am the moon. And in the endless sky we are but one. We are alive. In my dreams wolf and I. (Repeat). . Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh (4x). Aaah aaah aaah aaaah aaah (2x). . In the endless sky we are but one. Hmmmm mmm

Blue textures cascade downward to the base of the monolith. Like brush strokes on a canvas of souls. Two arms reach out a cloak of silent nihil. Revenants untouched by the scythe. They are lost in the dark woods of time. . Aloft in the landscape that you hail. I am the fog that seeps over here in the early hours. . Standing proud in the hollow of the land. A vestige of deeper purity etched in spirit agaisnt the sky. . The menhir had runes carved in limbs of oaken sovereignty. and could see the ages growing from within the palms. I can feel the era slipping into oblivion<comma>. no longer grasping the textures. I am slowly becoming stone. . As wolves celebrate the dusk<comma>. an old voice of wisdom haunts the vale. . Shapes flicker in the fire light through the windows. The woodlands burn with grace. Their silence drowns the age. . As wandering ghosts pass through the flames. A new age of rebirth lights the dawn. . But who are they who pass by the window?. The shapes; like black solar wheels scorched in the snow. by gods of the stone.... This elder stone shall never fall!. . Cast the aeons into the void. So that no other can seek them. No age<comma> no hands shall taint them. Pour the sorrows into the sun. They are lost forever in dark woods of time. Carve the symbols into the stone. So that another can find them. No age<comma> no hands shall change them. Pour the ages into the sun. They are lost forever in the dark woods of time
