Don't plagiarise or take 'on loan'. There's always someone<comma> somewhere. With a big nose who knows. And who trips you up and laughs. When you fall. Who'll trip you up and laugh. When you fall. You say: "Ere long done do does did". Words which could only be your own. And then produce the text. From whence was ripped. 'Some dizzy whore'<comma> 1804. A dreaded sunny day. So let's go where we're happy. And I meet you at the cemetry gates. Oh Keats and Yeats are on your side. A dreaded sunny day. So let's go where we're wanted. And I meet you at the cemetry gates. Keats and Yeats are on your side. But you lose. 'Cause weird lover Wilde is on mine. (<i>sugar</i>)

Always thought she'd stick around. always thought she'd stay. Now he's searching for the ring. the one she had to throw away. beach comber casts a shadow. long as his beard. never thought to cut it since his lover disappeared . she left him in this crazy state he's in . scouring the shoreline oh looking for the ring. oh the ring that was wrapped around her finger. she was just a dream and he was just a dreamer. there's a rhythm to his madness. a rhythm that he's in. retracing all the steps he walked. where once he was a king. his heart jolts awake to the beeps of. his machine starts racing faster faster. till it's a steady stream. he riffles through every grain of sand. one for everything that slipped through his hands. and his friends have all gone. gone with the tide. and he's standing on the shoreline. stranded in time. beach combing for his lost gold. something to have and to hold. oh small fortunes they sat and stay. too long to wash away. sweat dripping from his head. like a bridal shower. and dampening the gleaming sand. but mixed with tears so sour. coz he is just a dreamer . she was just a dream. he is just a dreamer. she was just a dream. he is just a dreamer she is just a dream . she is just a dream his is just a dreamer. she was just a dream . he is just a dreamer

I thank god you're comatose. As I pull back the bedclothes. And I can't believe my composure. And I can't remember my anger. And summer is a fish story. I wonder where we'll be

An ancient business<comma> a modern piece of glass work. Down on the corner that you walk each day in passing. The elderly sales clerk won't eye us with suspicion. The whole immortal corporation's given its permission. . A little stairway<comma> a little piece of carpet. A pair of mirrors that are facing one another. Out in both directions a thousand little Julia's. That come together in the middle of Manhattan. . You waited since lunch. It all comes at once. . Around the corner<comma> the house that modern art built. I ask for modern art to keep it out the closets. The people who might own it<comma> the sins of pride and envy. And on the second floor the Richard Serra Skate Park. . You waited since lunch. It all comes at once. . Sit on the park wall<comma> ask all the right questions. While all the horses racin' taxis in the winter. Look up at the buildings imagine who might live there. Imagining your Wolford's in a ball upon the sink there. . You waited since lunch.

Bons ou mauvais instants<comma> nos peines et toutes nos joies. J' n'oublierai pas ces moments-là.

Beep beep beep beep beep beep beep. go the horns in the cars in the street. we walked away from the lover's leap. opposite directions. synchronised feet. wait wait wait wait wait wait wait. for the time it takes a heart to mend a break. how many moons are reflected in the lake. can you wait forever if time is all it takes. despite all the warnings. I landed like. a fallen star. in your arms. beat beat beat beat beat beat beat. goes my heart on the side of my sleeve. whispering something I can hardly believe. "let me take the lead. cos love is all we need
