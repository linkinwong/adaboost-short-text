Packed and all eyes turned in<comma> no one to see on the quay. No one waving for me just the shoreline receding. Ticket in my hand<comma> I'm thinking wish I didn't hand it in. . 'Cause who said sailing is fine?. Leaving behind all the faces that I might replace. If I tried on that long ride. Looking deep inside but I don't want to look so deep inside yet. . Sit down<comma> sit down on the prow to wave bye. There might not be another star further on the line. Look out<comma> look out at each town that glides by. And there's another crowd to drown in crying eyes. . And see how that light you love now just won't shine. Well<comma> there might just be another star that's high and far in some other sky. We sing<comma> <i>"Is that marionette real enough yet. To step off of that set to decide what her hands might be doing?. Ruining the play<comma> to in the ensuing melee escape."</i>. . We packed up all of our bags. The ship's deck now sags from the weight of our tracks. As we pace beneath flags black and battered. Rattling our swords in service of some faded foreign lord. . And we sail out on orders from him but we find. The maps he sent to us don't mention lost coastlines. Where nothing we've actually seen has been mapped or outlined. And we don't recognize the names upon these signs. . And every night finds us rocking and rolling on waves wild and white. Well<comma> we have lost our way<comma> nobody's gonna say it outright. Just go la la la la la la la la la.... Oh<comma> la la la la la la la la la la la.... Oh<comma> oh<comma> oh. . La la la la la la. La la la la la.

How come you never go there?. How come I’m so alone there?. . I went up to the window. Lightning banging on the cymbals. I ripped into the night. Came storm into your eyes. . My horse had worked the fields too long. My bear had lost his innate calm. It’s true enough we’re not at peace. But peace is never what it seems. . Our love is not the light it was. When I walk inside the dark I’m calm. While we look for where it went. It’s only echoes in the melody. . How come you never go there?. How come I’m so alone there?. . We waste time on blame and weak revenge. Waste energy on projections. We’re living proof we've got an echo. And stop looking through the halo. . We carry on as if the time is through. You carry on as if I don’t love you. And so we find the way to die. To cut the heart out of the doubt now. . The room’s full but hearts are empty. Like the letters never sent me.

20 years of schooling. I just never learned the math. That one and one don't equal two. They often equal half. . I have tried to live the high life. The best that I know how. And I bought my share of debonair. And parlayed it on the crowd. . I do believe that there's no more tricks up my sleeve. The good old days have past and the good times after that. And slowly I've become undone. A stranger with a stranger heart. . Well I plan to hit the bottom. The bottle then the top. And I pray that something quits me. Before I gotta stop. .

While Wilde is on mine. So we go inside and we gravely read the stones. All those people<comma> all those lives. Where are they now?. With loves and hates. And passions just like mine. They were born. And then they lived. And then they died. Seems so unfair. I want to cry. You say: "Ere thrice the sun hath done. salutation to the dawn". And you claim these words as your own. But I've read well and I've heard them said. A hundred times (maybe less<comma> maybe more). If you must write prose or poems. The words you use should be your own. Don't plagiarise or take 'on loan'. There's always someone<comma> somewhere. With a big nose who knows. And who trips you up and laughs. When you fall. Who'll trip you up and laugh. When you fall. You say: "Ere long done do does did". Words which could only be your own. And then produce the text. From whence was ripped. 'Some dizzy whore'<comma> 1804. A dreaded sunny day. So let's go where we're happy. And I meet you at the cemetry gates. Oh Keats and Yeats are on your side. A dreaded sunny day. So let's go where we're wanted. And I meet you at the cemetry gates. Keats and Yeats are on your side. But you lose. 'Cause weird lover Wilde is on mine.

All the other girls here are stars - you are the northern lights. They try to shine in through your curtains - you're too close and too bright. They try and they try but everything that they do. Is the ghost of a trace of a pale imitation of you. I'll be the one to drive you back home Kathleen. . This party was made with the night air and the chance that a smile. Will wind its way from your face to one of the boys in your line. You act like you're hip to their tricks and you're strong. But a virgin Wurlitzer heart never once had a song. I'll be the one to drive you back home Kathleen. . And I'll have you back by break of day. I'm going your way anyway. And if you'd like to come along. I'll be yours for a song. . I know you are waiting and I know that it is not for me. But I'm here and I'm ready and I've saved you the passenger seat. I won't be your last dance just your last goodnight. Every heart is a package tangled up in knots someone else tied. I'll be the one to drive you back home Kathleen. . So crawl up your trellis and quietly back into your room. And I'll coast down the length of your drive by the light of the moon. And the next time I see you - a new kind of hello. Both our hearts have a secret only both of us know.

Baby canteen<comma> when i thought your heart stopped beating. The room brought out the silence in your breathing. A birth in wooded housing will help you live beyond the numbers. Let us pray to pan let in the light. And see us bathe and sleep among us. Smell the body of our elders. And wake up to the milky way at breakfast. I'll take the time to pick up all the widow makers broken . No real way to remember if we'll work again. . Color people say oh no<comma> cause they think it's contagious. Marshmallow people say oh yeah<comma> cause they think it's a masterpiece. . The sky has brakes . What a good day to rise. De Soto De Son will time. . Goodbye blue heron goodbye green fly goodbye goodbye. . I've got a raft you'll sail till the open lie in the lake. While your body is broken . When you go out I'll cry in the thicket. Shooting from school. There's a green where the crickets cry mom can't breathe and i know she's leaving. And that the birds of a quay are all good for the crocodile. So slow it down. Its not a race. Death takes time. Do you see it?. . Baby canteen swollen fingers in the water . I roped an Island pony for your birthday. I'll live in wooded housing till they put out all your needles.

The only place we had to meet was night. While the sun he sleeps in shadows we can hide. On the mountainside we spent our time together. But it is gone when morning comes. . And you are the wolf . And I am the moon. And in the endless sky we are but one. We are alive. In my dreams wolf and I. . How many days and nights will come and go. While the only light you'll see is from my glow.

Blue textures cascade downward to the base of the monolith. Like brush strokes on a canvas of souls. Two arms reach out a cloak of silent nihil. Revenants untouched by the scythe. They are lost in the dark woods of time. . Aloft in the landscape that you hail. I am the fog that seeps over here in the early hours. . Standing proud in the hollow of the land. A vestige of deeper purity etched in spirit agaisnt the sky. . The menhir had runes carved in limbs of oaken sovereignty. and could see the ages growing from within the palms. I can feel the era slipping into oblivion<comma>. no longer grasping the textures. I am slowly becoming stone. . As wolves celebrate the dusk<comma>. an old voice of wisdom haunts the vale. . Shapes flicker in the fire light through the windows. The woodlands burn with grace. Their silence drowns the age. . As wandering ghosts pass through the flames. A new age of rebirth lights the dawn. . But who are they who pass by the window?. The shapes; like black solar wheels scorched in the snow. by gods of the stone.... This elder stone shall never fall!. . Cast the aeons into the void. So that no other can seek them. No age<comma> no hands shall taint them. Pour the sorrows into the sun. They are lost forever in dark woods of time. Carve the symbols into the stone. So that another can find them. No age<comma> no hands shall change them. Pour the ages into the sun.
