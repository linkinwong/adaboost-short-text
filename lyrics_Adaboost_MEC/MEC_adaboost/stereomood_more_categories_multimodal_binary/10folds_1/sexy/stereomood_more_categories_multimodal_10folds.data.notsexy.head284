A long stone and my day's all serpentine. The tired tarnish in my chest rests sense of SARS. And one dull dawn where they hum that splits its length. Does my name sting your tongue?  Now does it beg?. . Your thin frame has set my eyes to fray. On our dim stretch of this street how it aches. For every grey and sad and taut to coil. And our frail eyes and there watch to finally talk. . One brash phrase cut crush these fragile days. My thoughts swirl in some shrill sad cannonade. And one such spur that caused my throat to creak. The one dull dawn that I've since sensed to repeat,calm.

Are you waiting for me?. At the end of the airport. I'm off buying our tickets. Auteur in hibernation. But I'm feeling impatient. We were late for departure. . And the smell of pajamas. Is what makes me feel frivol. There are minutes for sleeping. But we didn't have minutes to spare. . So you're feeling sleepy. Sympathize with the retard. Being held by his mother. She's got spit in her napkin. And she's pushing him that way. Like a stench to the men's room. . And it's making you nauseous. Where the hell have I got to?. There's a boy who's a Krishna.

As I was walkin' down rubadub square. Not a chill to the wind,happy.
A small Jean Genie snuck off to the city. Strung out on lasers and slash back blazers and. Ate all your razors while pulling the waiters. Talking 'bout Monroe and walking on Snow White. New York's a go-go and everything tastes nice. Poor little Greenie go,groovy.
As she walks in the room they will take me away. And the tenderness I feel will send the dark underneath. Will I follow?,calm.

As someone sets light to the first fire of autumn. We settle down to cut ourselves apart. Cough and twitch from the news on your face. And some foreign candle burning in your eyes. . Held to the past we've no recourse at all. . Blind to the last cursed affair. Pistols and countless lies. A trail of white blood betrays. The reckless route your craft is running. . Feed 'til the sun turns into wood. Dousing an ancient torch. Loiter the whole day through. And lose yourself in lines dissecting love,calm.

As soon as I got on the horse I forgot about the math.. Forgot about the odds against an adolescent standing up to all of Owen's wrath.. The heat of prairie summer is impossible to take.. I grab the hem and lift the fabric over my sweet head.. I know what you're looking for and I'm never gonna give it to you.. I'm never gonna give it to you.. I'm never gonna give it to you.. . Government rule established by a dazzling light show.. A hegemony armored with a thousand-watt head and seven inches of echo.. I keep up my velocity my spurs are in her sides.. I don't know what I'm doing and it is the only way.. Toward the range I'll ride. I'm never gonna give it to you.. I'm never gonna give it to you.. I'm never gonna give it to you.,lonely.
As the light hits you. Never get out again.,romantic.
As the spring is made alive the winter dies. And the final cries of creatures are long behind. And full of spirit the village starts again. With one more year for a man to change his ways. .

A strange form of life kicking through windows triggering odds. A strange one,lonely.
As we fall into sequence. And we're eating our young. Remain silent and still for modesty. . When the splints have been broken. And they can't help you now. Do you pray with your eyes closed naturally. . Follow me to nowhere. Woven with the utmost care. . If I'm lost please don't find me. If I drown let me sink. We descended from no one. With a wink. . When it's cold outside hold me. Don't hold me. When I choose to rest my eyes coax me. Don't coax me. When it's cold outside hold me. Don't hold me. When I choose to rest my eyes coax me. Don't coax me. . Follow me to nowhere. Woven with the utmost care. . Have they cleansed you with chloride. And scrubbed behind the knees. Has your body been hollowed by the breeze,high.
At last . My love has come along. My lonely days are over. And life is like a song. . Oh yeah yeah. At last. . The skies above are blue. My heart was wrapped up in clover.

At least in my dreams. when I'm sleeping it seems. that the needle is full endlessly it never comes to stay.. . and it never goes away.,sad.
At least I won't be shot for singing. I'm a free agent – I can protest. This must be freedom. I must be happy!. So let Mandela rot in prison. Someone should tell him how lucky he is. Read him George Orwell our Charm and our Brains. But how could he understand?. Heathen have no soul,funny.

at night we crossed the border following a Black robe. to the edge of the reservation—to Cataldo Mission. where the saints and all the martyrs look down on dying converts. . . Yeah. It's my home—last night I dreamt that I grew wings. I found a place where they could hear me when I sing.. . and so they came with cameras—breaking through the morning mist. press and businessmen—tycoons—Episcopal philanthropists. lost in their appraisal of the body of a woman. but all we saw were lowlands—clouds clung to mountains without strings. . and at last we saw some people... . at last we saw some people.... at last we saw some people huddled up against. the rain that was descending like railroad spikes and hammers. they were headed for the border—walking and then running. and then they were gone into the fog but Anne said underneath their jackets she saw wings,calm.

Baby canteen cause they think it's a masterpiece. . The sky has brakes . What a good day to rise. De Soto De Son will time. . Goodbye blue heron goodbye green fly goodbye goodbye. . I've got a raft you'll sail till the open lie in the lake. While your body is broken . When you go out I'll cry in the thicket. Shooting from school. There's a green where the crickets cry mom can't breathe and i know she's leaving. And that the birds of a quay are all good for the crocodile. So slow it down. Its not a race. Death takes time. Do you see it?. . Baby canteen swollen fingers in the water . I roped an Island pony for your birthday. I'll live in wooded housing till they put out all your needles. And drop you in and shelter near the highway,calm.
Baby for the miracle to come,sad.
Baby girls FM. And everybody’s looking like a girl to me,funny.
Baby ooh,nostalgic.
Baby's into running around. Hanging with the crowd. Putting your business in the street talking out loud. Saying you bought her this and that. And how much you done spent. I swear she must believe it's all heaven sent. Hey boy you better bring the chick around. To the sad. sad truth the dirty lowdown. . (Who I wonder who) taught her how to talk like that. (Who I wonder who) gave her that big idea. . Nothing you can't handle nothing you ain't got. Put the money on the table and drive it off the lot. Turn on that ole lovelight and turn a maybe to a yes. Same old schoolboy game got you into this mess. Hey son better get back to town. Face the sad old truth the dirty lowdown. . (Who I wonder who) put those ideas in your head. (Who I wonder who) yeah. Come on back down little son. Dig the low low low low lowdown. . You ain't got to be so bad got to be so cold. This dog eat dog existence sure is getting old. Got to have a Jones for this Jones for that. This running with the Joneses boy. Just ain't where it's at. You gonna come back around. To the sad sad truth the dirty lowdown. . (Who I wonder who) got you thinking like that boy. (Who I wonder who). (Who I wonder who said who I wonder who). Oh look out for that lowdown. That dirty dirty dirty dirty lowdown. (Who I wonder who ohh ohh). Got you thinking like that,groovy.
Baby's on fire. Better throw her in the water. Look at her laughing. Like a heifer to the slaughter. . Baby's on fire. And all the laughing boys are bitching. Waiting for photos. Oh the plot is so bewitching. . Rescuers row row. Do your best to change the subject. Blow the wind blow blow. Lend some assistance to the object. . Photographers snip snap. Take your time she's only burning. This kind of experience. Is necessary for her learning. . If you'll be my flotsam. I could be half the man I used to. They said you were hot stuff. And that's what baby's been reduced to. . Juanita and Juan. Very clever with maracas. Making their fortunes. Selling secondhand tobaccoes. . Juan dances at Chico's. And when the clients are evicted. He empties the ashtrays. And pockets all that he's collected. . But baby's on fire. And all the instruments agree that. Her temperature's rising. But any idiot would know that,happy.
Baby stay the night with you. And there's nothing that I got to prove. . Everyday I die a little. Everyday I live a lot. . Everyday I die a little. Everyday I live a lot,sad.

Bailey's her name and there's a price she takes. . Blurring lines while she ruthlessly raised the stakes. . And there's a mess that she made. . We kiss on the mouth with hearts that were bound and gagged. . The news was broke the witness was the Cascades. . Do you remember me? . 'Cause there's a piece of my mind in a field of dandelions. . Do you remember me? 'Cause there's a tale I tell. . It's made of rain and hell. . We will seldom speak our bodies became arsonists to will and brains. . To him the cold hearted thing was she came demanding rings. . The day was mute and hot. We will rarely talk. . I'm just where you left me alone by them lilacs.,lonely.

Basking in low gravity I want you back; the period a long ellipse.. You can lose the weight but it all comes back,sad.
Bass in your face. Not an eight track. Gettin' it good to the wood. So the people. Give you some a dat. Reactin' to the fax. That I kick and it stick. And it stay around. Pointin' to the joint left us faded. King and chief probably had a big beef. Because of dat now I grit my teeth. So here's a song to the strong. 'Bout a shake of a snake. And the smile went along wit dat. Can't truss it,groovy.

Beep beep beep beep beep beep beep. go the horns in the cars in the street. we walked away from the lover's leap. opposite directions. synchronised feet. wait wait wait wait wait wait wait. for the time it takes a heart to mend a break. how many moons are reflected in the lake. can you wait forever if time is all it takes. despite all the warnings. I landed like. a fallen star. in your arms. beat beat beat beat beat beat beat. goes my heart on the side of my sleeve. whispering something I can hardly believe. "let me take the lead. cos love is all we need,calm.
Before I let you down again . I just want to see you in your eyes . I would have taken everything out on you . I only thought you could understand . . They say every man goes blind in his heart . And they say everybody steals somebody's heart away . And I've got nothing more to say about it . Nothing more than you would me . . Send me your flowers of your december . Send me your dreams of your candy wine . I got just one thing I can't give you . Just one more thing of mine . . They say every man goes blind in his heart . They say everybody steals somebody's heart away . And I've been wondering why you let me down . And I been taking it all for granted,calm.

Before the world you know was like it is. I held a lover once and I was his. And we walked along the river in the sun. But he's a lonely man so this was done. The only place we had to meet was night. While the sun he sleeps in shadows we can hide. On the mountainside we spent our time together. But it is gone when morning comes. . And you are the wolf . And I am the moon. And in the endless sky we are but one. We are alive. In my dreams wolf and I. . How many days and nights will come and go. While the only light you'll see is from my glow. There will never be a dawn that breaks the spell surrounding us. . Til the earth dies with the sun. . And you are the wolf . And I am the moon. And in the endless sky we are but one. We are alive. In my dreams wolf and I. (Repeat). . Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh (4x). Aaah aaah aaah aaaah aaah (2x). . In the endless sky we are but one. Hmmmm mmm,sad.

Black night is not right. I don't feel so bright. I don't care to sit tight. Maybe I'll find on the way down the line. That I'm free free to be me. Black night is a long way from home,groovy.
Blue here is a shell for you. Inside you'll hear a sigh. A foggy lullaby. There is your from me. (yudha),calm.

Blue textures cascade downward to the base of the monolith. Like brush strokes on a canvas of souls. Two arms reach out a cloak of silent nihil. Revenants untouched by the scythe. They are lost in the dark woods of time. . Aloft in the landscape that you hail. I am the fog that seeps over here in the early hours. . Standing proud in the hollow of the land. A vestige of deeper purity etched in spirit agaisnt the sky. . The menhir had runes carved in limbs of oaken sovereignty. and could see the ages growing from within the palms. I can feel the era slipping into oblivion no hands shall change them. Pour the ages into the sun. They are lost forever in the dark woods of time,angry.
Bobby went out for a joy ride with my best girl. Everyone said that when the ambulance came. The paramedics could hear Free Bird still playing on the stereo.. . You know it's a very long song.,sad.
[Bon Iver]. I shoot the lights out. So I-I am headed home,angry.
Born to be down. I've learned all my lessons before now. Born to be down. I think you'll get used to it. . And you just don't get it you know it's so pathetic. . And you don't,angry.
Boy was wrong would feel like strange. Boneless. This town is all in Hell. Boneless. This town is all in Hell. Boneless. You know you would always run from here,high.

Breathe life to the street from the mouth. Those ruby red lips have much to give. Pull life from the land with your capable hands. Those life loving beautiful broken hands. Oh not withering. . Like a falling leaf who keeps her green. I'm turning bright in the sea. Where a merman with a twinkle casts a hook in me,happy.

Burn out more money. The helpless slob in his dead-end day job. Helpless slob in his dead-end day job. I'm reaching every goal. Maybe a girlfriend under control. An easy target and drag-down anchor. The co-dependent self-styled nightmare. And it's a shame ‘cuz I really don't care. I drop it off but I leave it hanging there,energetic.
