Someone else you know always is. If Heaven's really coming back. I hope it has a heart attack. When they see how dangerous it is for guys like that.

But I'm not looking for an easy way out. This whole life it's been about. Try and try and try. And try and try and try. To be simple again

Backstroke lover. Always hidin' 'neath the covers. "Can I talk to you" my daddy<comma> he say. He said "You ain't seen nothin'. Till you're down on a muffin.

<b>Day after day. Still freeman in my mind. So many days. Waiting to see the sign. Don't stop singing everywhere. Just try to live from day to day. Time is going by far away</b>. . Toujours la meme histoire<comma> vous sentez. La chose qui s'répète<comma> le temps est bien trop pressé. Toujours la meme histoire vous tremblez. Stop le stress<comma> nos maladresses<comma> l'horloge continue de tourner. Il file entre nos doigts<comma> défile au rythme de nos pas. Nous fait des signes qu'on ne voit pas. Il nous regarde s'éteindre<comma> s'allumer puis se plaindre. S'amuser et s'éteindre<comma> c'est un constat. Pourquoi on court? Autant de discours. J'ai peur que ce qui m'entoure finisse par m'atteindre. Le tiers-monde court à sa perte<comma> on devient sourd. J'm'appelle Bouchkour welcome to my land. Stop the time I become crazy. Stop the time I am crazy. . . J'ai les mains pleines de promesses dans ce perpétuel mouvement. En sens inverse chaque minute ramène au présent. Tout s'accélère<comma> le passé devient faiblesse. Chacun ses fantômes et ses tourments. J'ai laissé toutes mes vieilles rancoeur derrière moi. Comme si j'ouvrais mon coeur pour la dernière fois. Le temps file entre mes doigts.... Comment faire le compte de ce que j'ai raté à cause de mes choix?. Les aiguilles courent<comma> je les poursuis. Elles filent jour après jour mais ca ne suffit. A rattraper tout le temps perdu<comma> toutes ces heures investies. A gagner tous toute une vie. On ne peut stocker l'amour au fond d'un puits. Car c'est au jour le jour qu'on le construit. Profite de chaque instant vécu. N'avoir aucun regret lorsque tout ici sera fini !. J'ai les mains pleines de richesses mais je ne parle pas d'argent. Car on progresse dans notre voie passionnément. J'ai laissé derrière tant de moments importants. Maintenant je l'ai compris a mes dépens. Et puis tout s'ouvre devant moi<comma> malgré ce que l'on laisse derrière soi. Bons ou mauvais instants<comma> nos peines et toutes nos joies. J' n'oublierai pas ces moments-là.
Been round this road so many times . Feel like it's skin is part of mine . This taste of milk is almost gone . Still got my shame<comma> but not for long! . Been wrong so many times before . But never quite like this . And oh<comma> it rained<comma> but the rain all turned to piss. . I hope to make it home one day. I doubt that day will come. I know<comma> by now<comma> that my days they're all gone
Beep beep beep beep beep beep beep. go the horns in the cars in the street. we walked away from the lover's leap. opposite directions. synchronised feet. wait wait wait wait wait wait wait. for the time it takes a heart to mend a break. how many moons are reflected in the lake. can you wait forever if time is all it takes. despite all the warnings. I landed like. a fallen star. in your arms. beat beat beat beat beat beat beat. goes my heart on the side of my sleeve. whispering something I can hardly believe. "let me take the lead. cos love is all we need
Beginning of the end. of the heart was once my friend.. The nature of that place. sends a sweet smell around my head.. Oh well.. . The hardest thing of all:. the heartbreak of our loss.. Hiding on the tire<comma>. we were cast out of everywhere.. . But enough.. Last time.... The last time I remember.... The last time I remember<comma>. it was God(?).. . How I want you to know. how far west we will go.. Hand in hand<comma> in and out. All our days in this love.. . All my toys are dead. . Unravelled at the stairs.. Open<comma> but who cares?. Why?
Beverly Hills. Burning of plastic. Scraped it away<comma> I do<comma> I may. For the summer. For the summer. . Here goes your man. Dances the hourly. Cape land to colors. Was rolling through the valley. For the summer. For the summer. . Hold tight<comma> horizon minds. It's writing it's name in the sky. It's paradise. We fade away into the night. . Beverly Hills. Nuclear winter. What should we wear. And who's for dinner?. In the summer. For the summer. . Hold tight<comma> our love will fade out. It's writing it's name in the sky. And I'll stop and stare. We'll fade away into the night. It's paradise. . For now we go under the knife. For one time. Oh<comma> some doctors divided by night time. . Let's do it for the summer. Send for the sunrise. Let's do it for the summer. Send for the sunrise. . Let's do it for the summer. Send for the sunrise. Let's do it for the summer. Send for the sunrise
