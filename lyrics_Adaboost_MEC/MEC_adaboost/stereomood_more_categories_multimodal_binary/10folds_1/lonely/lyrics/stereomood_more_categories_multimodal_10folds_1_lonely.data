It's been a long and lonely trip but I'm glad that I took it because it was well worth it.. I got to read a couple books and do some research before I reached my verdict.. Never thought that I was perfect. Always thought that I had a purpose.. Used to wonder if I'd live to see my first kiss.. . The most difficult thing I ever did was recite my own words at a service. Realizing the person I was addressing probably wasn't looking down from heaven.. Or cooking up something in hell's kitchen<comma> trying to listen in or eaves drop from some another dimension.. It was self serving just like this is.. . Conveniently religious on Easter Sunday and on Christmas.. The television went from being a babysitter to a mistress.. Technology made it easy for us to stay in touch while keeping a distance<comma>. 'til we just stayed distant and never touched. Now all we do is text too much.. . I don't remember much from my youth. Maybe my memory is repressed.. Or I just spent too much time wondering if I'd live to have sex.. Fell in love for the first time in 4th grade but I didn't have the courage to talk to her.. In 8th grade I wrote her the note but I slipped it in someone else's locker.. . Considered killing myself 'cause of that.. It was a big deal. It was a blown cover.. It was over for me. My goose was cooked.. Stick a fork in me. The jig is up.. I blew my chances<comma> the rest is history<comma> our future was torn asunder.. It became abundantly clear that I was only brought here to suffer.. . At least I didn't include my name.. Thankfully I wrote the whole note in code. And it had 10 layers of scotch tape safety seal making it impossible to open.. Plus<comma> it was set to self destruct.. Whoever read it probably died…laughing.. I wonder if they lived long enough to realize what happened.. . A year later<comma> I came to understand that wasn't love that I was feeling for her.. I had someone else to obsess over.. I was older. I was very mature.. I forged my time signature while practicing my parents autograph 'cause I was failing math.. Disconnected the phone when I thought the teacher would call my home.. . I checked the mailbox twice a day at the end of a long dirt road.. Steamed open a couple envelopes like I was in private detective mode.. If you snoop around long enough for something in particular you're guaranteed to find it.. For better or worse that's how I learned that it's best to just keep some things private.. . It was the best of times. It was the end of times.. . It was the best of times. It was the end of times.. I was always on deck<comma> I was next in line.. An only child with a pen and pad writing a list of things that I could never have.. The walls in my house were paper thin.. Every squabble seemed to get deafening.. If my memory serves me correctly I made it a point to void and forget some things.. Probably to keep from being embarrassed.. Never meant to upset or give grief to my parents.. Kept my secrets…hid my talents…. In my head<comma> never under the mattress.. . Therapy couldn't break me.. Never learned a word that would insure safety.. So I spoke softly and I tip toed often.. The door to my room was like a big old coffin.. The way that it creeked when I closed it shut.. Anxieties peaked when it opened up.. As if everything that I was thinking would be exposed.. I still sleep fully clothed.. . It was the best of times.. . It was beautiful.. It was brutal.. It was cruel.. It was business as usual.. . Heaven. It was hell.. Used to wonder if I'd live to see 12.. . When I did I figured that I was immortal.. Loved to dance but couldn't make it to the formal.. Couldn't bear watching my imaginary girlfriend. Bust a move with any other dudes.. . Tone Loc was talking bout a "Wild Thang". But I was still caught up in some child thangs.. Scared of a God who couldn't spare the rod.. It was clearly a brimstone and fire thang.. . Pyromaniac. Kleptomaniac.. Couldn't explain my desire to steal that fire.. Now I add it to my rider.. Like "Please oh please don't throw me in that patch of brier!". . It was the best of times. It was the end of times.. . The school counselor was clueless 'cause I never skipped classes.. Perfect attendance. Imperfect accent.. Speech impediment they could never really fix. And I faked bad eyesight so I could wear glasses.. . Considered doing something that would cripple me.. I wanted a wheelchair. I wanted the sympathy.. I wanted straight teeth so then came braces.. 4 years of head gear helped me change faces.. . It was the best of times. It was the end of times.. . Now I wonder if I'll live to see marriage.. Wonder if I'll live long enough to have kids.. Wonder if I'll live to see my kids have kids.. If I do I'm gonna tell 'em how it is.. . "Don't listen when they tell you that these are your best years.. Don't let anybody protect your ears.. It's best that you hear what they don't want you to hear.. It's better to have pressure from peers than not have peers.. Beer won't give you chest hair. Spicy food won't make it curl.. When you think you've got it all figured out and then everything collapses…. Trust me<comma> kid…it's not the end of the world.",lonely.

I saw you lookin' at me girl. When I first set foot into the room. You didn't want me to see girl. You didn't wanna lay your cards so soon. I see you rollin' it over. You wonder what your friends might think of you. Angel on your shoulder<comma> but you know just you wanna do. . Well I don't need to know a thing about your past. No I just want one night with you no strings attached. And I know that we might not be a perfect match. I just want one night with you no strings attached. . I know you tryin' to be good girl. But you imagine what I'm like in bed. You try to push it aside girl. But it already went through your head. . It's one o'clock in the morning. And you're buzzin' like a honey bee. Oh why you trying to control it<comma>. When you wanna just come home with me?. . Well I don't need to know a thing about your past. No I just want one night with you no strings attached. And I know that we might not be a perfect match. I just want one night with you no strings attached. . I don't want to think this through. I just want one night with you. No I don't want to think things through. I just want one night with you girl,lonely.
Step on my toes. Riddle my road. Now I can't find my own way back. Leave me to lie with you chasing my eyes. So I fall for you one last time. How do you know if a pocket of gold. Will ever be enough to say "I do"?. . [Chorus]. . No<comma> now it's too late for lovers. Save me<comma> why won't you save me?. When I gave you my whole world. To leave this holy roller trap. If I only knew the day that I lose would be up to you. Because you know you said forever. Still I am passing through. . Cut me a heart from the milkyway stars. To remember when we fell in love. You promised to take me on the carnival ride. But your ring a rosie shot that through. Now nothing you say and nothing you do will ever bring me back to you. . [Chorus]. . No<comma> no it's too late for lovers. Save me<comma> why won't you save me?. When I gave you my whole world. To leave this holy roller trap. If I only knew the day that I lose would be up to you.

Don't want to be here. All I see are angels. I am no angel. . [Chorus]. . It's too late for lovers. Save me<comma> why won't you save me?. When I gave you my whole world.

The moon is a magnet. Everyone's at it. Everyone's had it. . Love is a sadness. Love is a madness. We are the addicts. . What are we if we're not in love?. What are we if we're not in love?.

I awoke cold and alone<comma> adrift in the open sea. Caught up in regrets and tangled in nets instead of your arms wrapped around me. And I wept but my tears are anathema here<comma> just more water to fill my lungs. I hear someone scream "God<comma> what is it we have done?". . I am drowning in a digital sea.

In place of the sun. In place of the moon. A terrible light. Will flood every room. . And bathed in this light<comma>. We will swim again. From the high desert's walls. To the seas<comma> red and black. . Turn the transmitters off. We are not coming back. And the pearls of our eyes<comma>. Are turning black. . And when it occurred<comma> oh<comma> yes. Sir<comma> yes<comma> sir. And the walls came down<comma> it was. A fucking disaster. The whole thing's changed in. Unthinkable ways. And now you have come to inherit it. . But why did you come<comma>. To corral everyone?. When you're just pushing the. Darkness around,lonely.

You hear my cry lover of mine. No tear in the eye or fear in my mind. The forest is thick and we don't recognize. We parted our lips and we reached from inside. . In a wide open field. We know we can feel. Awake and unreal. Off to nowhere. Off to nowhere. Off to nowhere. . Need more people to be satisfied. No fear of a god and a prayer for the night. You come into our minds and you rush through our lives. We parted our lips and we reached from inside. . In a wide open field. We know we can feel. Awake and unreal. Off to nowhere. Off to nowhere. . The only thing you've got. You know you're better off without it. . Youngest fire. You decide. You decide. What is right. Youngest fire. Who decides. We decide. What is right. Near yet so far.

I know you've become disheartened and disillusioned by the current state of affairs. Your stocks are falling<comma> your investments have failed you. The man from whom you took orders has been ordered to jail by his and your subordinates. You question what is this world coming to. What is the profit margin when you're forced to pander to the marginalized. Where's the glory you dreamt of as a child... Dressed as a cowboy<comma> your play gun pointed at real targets. Your mother<comma> holding her tongue as your father consoles her with the words... “it's just boy stuff”. . Well. You joined his fraternity<comma> you grew into his old suits.

Note the energy swirling from its center. How it illumines us all and only the birds fly first class.... . There is your inheritance!. The warmth of a kiss. Invest your tongue into the mouth of mystery. Allow her breath to seep into your lungs and surrender to her touch and guidance. There's no other way. Your dreams of dominance will only help you forsake yourself. While your family continues its search for understanding. And your daughters outlive your sons...,lonely.

Well morning came. And it dressed the sky. In a lovely yellow gown. And the shops they are. All opening. In that narrow hallway of downtown. Filled with people who. Are shopping for. Their lovers and their friends. Saying they won't ever be lonely again. . Well a forest fenced. becomes backyards. Like songs are born from sound. And the apple fell. And it taught us all.

See a painful blue. When you stare into the sky. You could never understand. The motion of a hand waving goodbye. But as the story goes. or it is often told. A new day will arise.

I walk along the street. I look into your eyes. I'm pleasant when we meet. I'm there when you go home. How many times before. Could you tell I didn't care?. When you turned your back on me.

Baby canteen<comma> when i thought your heart stopped beating. The room brought out the silence in your breathing. A birth in wooded housing will help you live beyond the numbers. Let us pray to pan let in the light. And see us bathe and sleep among us. Smell the body of our elders. And wake up to the milky way at breakfast. I'll take the time to pick up all the widow makers broken . No real way to remember if we'll work again. . Color people say oh no<comma> cause they think it's contagious. Marshmallow people say oh yeah<comma> cause they think it's a masterpiece. . The sky has brakes . What a good day to rise. De Soto De Son will time. . Goodbye blue heron goodbye green fly goodbye goodbye. . I've got a raft you'll sail till the open lie in the lake. While your body is broken . When you go out I'll cry in the thicket. Shooting from school. There's a green where the crickets cry mom can't breathe and i know she's leaving. And that the birds of a quay are all good for the crocodile. So slow it down. Its not a race. Death takes time. Do you see it?. . Baby canteen swollen fingers in the water . I roped an Island pony for your birthday. I'll live in wooded housing till they put out all your needles. And drop you in and shelter near the highway,notlonely

Fooled the black<comma> left us faded. King and chief probably had a big beef. Because of dat now I grit my teeth. So here's a song to the strong. 'Bout a shake of a snake. And the smile went along wit dat. Can't truss it. Kickin' wicked rhymes. Like a fortune teller. 'Cause the wickedness done by Jack. Where everybody at. Divided and sold. For liquor and the gold. Smacked in the back. For the other man to mack. Now the story that I'm kickin' is gory. Little Rock where they be. Dockin' this boat. No hope I'm shackled. Plus gang tackled. By the other hand swingin' the rope. Wearin' red<comma> white and blue Jack and his crew. The guy's authorized beat down for the brown. Man to the man<comma> each one so it teach one. Born to terrorize sisters and every brother. One love who said it. I know Whodini sang it. But the hater taught hate. That's why we gang bang it. Beware of the hand. When it's comin' from the left. I ain't trippin' just watch ya step. Can't truss it. An I judge everyone<comma> one by the one. Look here come the judge. Watch it here he come now. I can only guess what's happ'nin'. Years ago he woulda been. The ships captain. Gettin' me bruised on a cruise. What I got to lose<comma> lost all contact. Got me layin' on my back. Rollin' in my own leftover. When I roll over<comma> I roll over in somebody else's. 90 F--kin' days on a slave ship. Count 'em fallin' off 2<comma> 3<comma> 4 hun'ed at a time. Blood in the wood and it's mine. I'm chokin' on spit feelin' pain. Like my brain bein' chained. Still gotta give it what I got. But it's hot in the day<comma> cold in the night. But I thrive to survive<comma> I pray to god to stay alive. Attitude boils up inside. And that ain't it (think I'll every quit). Still I pray to get my hands 'round. The neck of the man wit' the whip. 3 months pass<comma> they brand a label on my ass. To signify. Owned. I'm on the microphone. Sayin' 1555. How I'm livin'. We been livin' here. Livin' ain't the word. I been givin'. Haven't got. Classify us in the have-nots. Fightin' haves. 'Cause it's all about money. When it comes to Armageddon. Mean I'm getting mine. Here I am turn it over Sam. 427 to the year. Do you understand. That's why it's hard. For the black to love the land. Once again. Bass in your face. Not an eight track. Gettin' it good to the wood. So the people. Give you some a dat. Reactin' to the fax. That I kick and it stick. And it stay around. Pointin' to the joint<comma> put the Buddha down. Goin'<comma> goin'<comma> gettin' to the roots. Ain't givin' it up. So turn me loose. But then again I got a story. That's harder than the hardcore. Cost of the holocaust.

Burn out<comma> man. Typically bitter. Find me locked into the vicious cycle. Find me trapped and scared simple. Money<comma> money<comma> money. Money<comma> more money. The helpless slob in his dead-end day job. Helpless slob in his dead-end day job. I'm reaching every goal. Maybe a girlfriend under control. An easy target and drag-down anchor. The co-dependent self-styled nightmare. And it's a shame ‘cuz I really don't care. I drop it off but I leave it hanging there,notlonely

By Palm Desert to market to buy.. Tenderfoot up to date palms of the real estate.. By Palm Desert springs often run dry.. . I came west unto Hollywood<comma> never-never land.. Juxtaposed to B.B.D. and O. Beyond San Fernando on hillside manors on the banks of toxicity those below and those above the same.. . Dreams are still born in Hollywood I don't understand.. Just suppose the youngster knows he's had a good deal of fortune and up through the babble on the fair banks complicity<comma>. Buy your leave or stay beyond the game.. . Palm Desert not fade away.. Palm Desert I wish I could stay.. Palm Desert sages abound.. So head your head to the ground round.. . Meanwhile in the wild west of Hollywood age is losing hold.. Inasmuch as you are touched to have withstood by the very old search for the truth within the bounds of toxicity.. Left unsung so I have strung the frame.,notlonely
