'It\'s been a long and lonely trip but I\'m glad that I took it because it was well worth it.\r\nI got to read a couple books and do some research before I reached my verdict.\r\nNever thought that I was perfect. Always thought that I had a purpose.\r\nUsed to wonder if I\'d live to see my first kiss.\r\n\r\nThe most difficult thing I ever did was recite my own words at a service\r\nRealizing the person I was addressing probably wasn\'t looking down from heaven.\r\nOr cooking up something in hell\'s kitchen, trying to listen in or eaves drop from some another dimension.\r\nIt was self serving just like this is.\r\n\r\nConveniently religious on Easter Sunday and on Christmas.\r\nThe television went from being a babysitter to a mistress.\r\nTechnology made it easy for us to stay in touch while keeping a distance,\r\n\'til we just stayed distant and never touched. Now all we do is text too much.\r\n\r\nI don\'t remember much from my youth. Maybe my memory is repressed.\r\nOr I just spent too much time wondering if I\'d live to have sex.\r\nFell in love for the first time in 4th grade but I didn\'t have the courage to talk to her.\r\nIn 8th grade I wrote her the note but I slipped it in someone else\'s locker.\r\n\r\nConsidered killing myself \'cause of that.\r\nIt was a big deal. It was a blown cover.\r\nIt was over for me. My goose was cooked.\r\nStick a fork in me. The jig is up.\r\nI blew my chances, the rest is history, our future was torn asunder.\r\nIt became abundantly clear that I was only brought here to suffer.\r\n\r\nAt least I didn\'t include my name.\r\nThankfully I wrote the whole note in code\r\nAnd it had 10 layers of scotch tape safety seal making it impossible to open.\r\nPlus, it was set to self destruct.\r\nWhoever read it probably died…laughing.\r\nI wonder if they lived long enough to realize what happened.\r\n\r\nA year later, I came to understand that wasn\'t love that I was feeling for her.\r\nI had someone else to obsess over.\r\nI was older. I was very mature.\r\nI forged my time signature while practicing my parents autograph \'cause I was failing math.\r\nDisconnected the phone when I thought the teacher would call my home.\r\n\r\nI checked the mailbox twice a day at the end of a long dirt road.\r\nSteamed open a couple envelopes like I was in private detective mode.\r\nIf you snoop around long enough for something in particular you\'re guaranteed to find it.\r\nFor better or worse that\'s how I learned that it\'s best to just keep some things private.\r\n\r\nIt was the best of times. It was the end of times.\r\n\r\nIt was the best of times. It was the end of times.\r\nI was always on deck, I was next in line.\r\nAn only child with a pen and pad writing a list of things that I could never have.\r\nThe walls in my house were paper thin.\r\nEvery squabble seemed to get deafening.\r\nIf my memory serves me correctly I made it a point to void and forget some things.\r\nProbably to keep from being embarrassed.\r\nNever meant to upset or give grief to my parents.\r\nKept my secrets…hid my talents…\r\nIn my head, never under the mattress.\r\n\r\nTherapy couldn\'t break me.\r\nNever learned a word that would insure safety.\r\nSo I spoke softly and I tip toed often.\r\nThe door to my room was like a big old coffin.\r\nThe way that it creeked when I closed it shut.\r\nAnxieties peaked when it opened up.\r\nAs if everything that I was thinking would be exposed.\r\nI still sleep fully clothed.\r\n\r\nIt was the best of times.\r\n\r\nIt was beautiful.\r\nIt was brutal.\r\nIt was cruel.\r\nIt was business as usual.\r\n\r\nHeaven. It was hell.\r\nUsed to wonder if I\'d live to see 12.\r\n\r\nWhen I did I figured that I was immortal.\r\nLoved to dance but couldn\'t make it to the formal.\r\nCouldn\'t bear watching my imaginary girlfriend\r\nBust a move with any other dudes.\r\n\r\nTone Loc was talking bout a \"Wild Thang\"\r\nBut I was still caught up in some child thangs.\r\nScared of a God who couldn\'t spare the rod.\r\nIt was clearly a brimstone and fire thang.\r\n\r\nPyromaniac. Kleptomaniac.\r\nCouldn\'t explain my desire to steal that fire.\r\nNow I add it to my rider.\r\nLike \"Please oh please don\'t throw me in that patch of brier!\"\r\n\r\nIt was the best of times. It was the end of times.\r\n\r\nThe school counselor was clueless \'cause I never skipped classes.\r\nPerfect attendance. Imperfect accent.\r\nSpeech impediment they could never really fix\r\nAnd I faked bad eyesight so I could wear glasses.\r\n\r\nConsidered doing something that would cripple me.\r\nI wanted a wheelchair. I wanted the sympathy.\r\nI wanted straight teeth so then came braces.\r\n4 years of head gear helped me change faces.\r\n\r\nIt was the best of times. It was the end of times.\r\n\r\nNow I wonder if I\'ll live to see marriage.\r\nWonder if I\'ll live long enough to have kids.\r\nWonder if I\'ll live to see my kids have kids.\r\nIf I do I\'m gonna tell \'em how it is.\r\n\r\n\"Don\'t listen when they tell you that these are your best years.\r\nDon\'t let anybody protect your ears.\r\nIt\'s best that you hear what they don\'t want you to hear.\r\nIt\'s better to have pressure from peers than not have peers.\r\nBeer won\'t give you chest hair. Spicy food won\'t make it curl.\r\nWhen you think you\'ve got it all figured out and then everything collapses…\r\nTrust me, kid…it\'s not the end of the world.\"',lonely
