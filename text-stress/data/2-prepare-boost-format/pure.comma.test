Okay,nostress
I watched a movie called Machete,nostress
uh Its actually a really good its kind of violent,nostress

for anyone else i -- if you want an enjoyable movie I think you should really watch it,nostress
um Recently I have a lot of presentations,nostress
projects which I need to work upon,nostress
The mec- mechanical courses actually um are the toughest for me,nostress
they involve a lot of thinking,stress
I have -- It's my second year,nostress
I have two more years to graduate,nostress
uh I have my exams like after two weeks,nostress
I need to put in a lot of effort to (( )) well in them,stress
I n/a have a lot of homework <comma> too,stress
Recently I've seen a movie called Inception,nostress
It's a thriller n/a,nostress
my favorite types of movies are comedies,nostress
thrillers,nostress
Yeah I like Indian food a lot um,nostress
it's got a lot of flavor  <comma> it's really spicy,nostress
good to eat,nostress
I don't know how to make it,nostress
I know places from where I can get it,nostress
uh last week I saw the movie Inception <comma> which was a very good movie starring Leonardo DiCaprio which is uh about stealing other people's uh dreams,nostress
planting ideas,nostress
It’s the first movie that talks about lucid dreaming,nostress
Uh I think I get along pretty good with people here I mean compared to high school ofcourse these guys are more mature,nostress
uh at the same time there is more diverse cultures here,nostress
you can uh  -- you can share your experieces <comma> your food <comma> your cultures <comma> etc,nostress
When it comes to local students they are a bit hard to get in touch to,nostress
they already have their group of friends,stress
--,nostress
I try -- I try integrating into Hong Kong societies -- uh local society by joining their events etc,nostress
Recent work is uh hard to focus on,stress
um job applications are taking -- is taking up,stress
much time <comma> uh making it hard to focus on current work,stress
Well compared to high school university socialsing I suppose is a lot a lot better,nostress
y -- the people you meet are,nostress
much more varied you meet people from all walks of life that you would never have gotten a chance to know in high school,nostress
in high school uh your friends are all -- all come from very similar background,nostress
--,nostress
your interests are the same,nostress
in university you learn about things that you -- that you would never ever have know before,nostress
uh How I get along with local students I suppose I get on better -- get along better with them than other internationals,nostress
I was born here,nostress
I can -- I can understand cantonese,nostress
I speak mandarin,nostress
still not to not to a very satisfactory extent,nostress
um I can -- I can -- I can speak to them,stress
uh none of them are my close friends uh none of my close friends are locals,nostress
in a -- in a way it's difficult to uh properly bond with them,nostress
What courses I think are the most difficult uh well I think what -- what courses I find easier than others are courses where it -- where it requires more understanding I suppose,nostress
where the exams are not simply true or false or multiple choice where you can um -- where you can explain your reasoning,nostress
then the -- there isn't really a -- a definite right,nostress
wrong answer,nostress
the courses that I find more -- to be more difficult I think would be those that require a definite answer the more quan -- quantitative subjects,nostress
I've been to Europe for holiday half a year ago um I've been to like Greece <comma> Italy,nostress
Spain,nostress
um I like the place,nostress
it has totally different ah culture <comma> background,nostress
it's very nice to see the beautiful views,nostress
At the moment <comma> um one thing I am very anxious about is going -- going to army <comma> of course,stress
that totally you know ruins everything,stress
Uh I don't really -- I'm not really worried about uh employment or academic life,stress
it is mostly about my future,nostress
Um my hometown is Seoul <comma> Korea,nostress
Um I recommend ah you go to eat some Korean food in Seoul,nostress
There many new Korean restaurants,nostress
Um you can also go to some old palaces to -- to see traditional stuff about Korea,nostress
I prefer my hometown over Hong Kong,nostress
you know it is my country,nostress
I feel more comfortable there,nostress
uh Yes my parents gave me a lot of pressure,stress
I'm the only child in the family,stress
they have a lot of expectations on me,stress
also my friends gave me a little bit pressure that's called peer pressure ((yea)),stress
I try to deal with that right now,stress
um im more anxious about my maybe love life,nostress
im being quite busy with my academic life,stress
i haven't devote much of time like relationship stuff like that,stress
yeah,stress
I'm adapting pretty good to college life um friends are good here the environment is really good <comma> beautiful view,nostress
I in the end I chose marketing,nostress
finance as my major,nostress
um The food I like most is ah tr -- traditional cantonese soup um it's -- it's the kind of food that you have uh -- the soup that you have to make it for like two hours or,nostress
I like it even the one in our university canteen um I don't know how to make it,nostress
it's really complicated,nostress
i can really buy -- i can buy it in the restaurants,nostress
ah My home town is Beijing um there's nothing really special about it <comma> just the capital city of china I recommend people to go to the great wall <comma> the tiananmen square um probably that's it for beijing,nostress
I -- I prefer Beijing than Hong Kong,nostress
it's bigger,nostress
people do get like more personal space than Hong Kong,nostress
Yeah I've been to -- been for a holiday in Goa <comma> it's a place in India -- uh a beach place in India,nostress
I like the place um,nostress
of the beach,nostress
the girls,nostress
everything,nostress
Um <comma> in the university I'm actually most anxious about my academic life,nostress
uh I really want to do well,stress
that later on I can get a good job over here,stress
have a good future,nostress
Um <comma> when it comes to life I'm anxious about everything,nostress
you don't know what is going to happen you can't predict the outcome,stress
here it asks me employment academic life relationship love life <comma> ofcourse I'm nervous about that who isn't,nostress
College life is uh easy to adapt to,nostress
um It’s more the academic side of it that’s a little bit challenging,nostress
the social side is uh liberating,stress
Yeah my favorite past time is playing football <comma> I like it,nostress
of Cristiano Ronaldo,nostress
Ah recently I’ve seen this Korean ah ~TV show which is called super star K,nostress
it's like American idol,nostress
It’s like a singing contest,nostress
Well <comma> uh I do a lot of activities for leisure like surfing the Internet <comma> playing a lot of games like badminton,nostress
table tennis,nostress
um I think communications play a very important role in helping me to get along with other people uh you need to express yourself very clearly,nostress
try to understand others uh from their perspective -- um compared to high school I think I prefer college life,nostress
the way people try to get along with each other here -- um I get along pretty well with local students,nostress
I speak Cantonese natively,nostress
I think I would have not that many difficulties in intergrating into Hong Kong society um,nostress
definately I prefer Hong Kong over my home town,nostress
this is a more global society for me,nostress
I meet different groups of people from everywhere,nostress
I think I have a lot of close friends uh since I came to Hong Kong,nostress
Ah i think the most difficult course right now for like these 3 years are -- is machine learning I took that course for like three or four classes,stress
i dropped it,stress
I can't really understand what they're talking about in the class,nostress
I think the most difficult courses are the ones that uh deal with a lot of equations a lot of different mathematical concepts,nostress
The reason is uh I think my skill set would be more of uh dealing with uh concepts instead of mathematical models,nostress
um I'm not picky as long as it's vegeterian food uh pizza <comma> pasta <comma> indian food anything does,nostress
uh How do I get along with other people well I guess you should be asking other people that question uh I think I get along with other people okay most of the time,nostress
I'm pretty sure that it's getting better all the time,nostress
every time you meet someone new you learn more about it,nostress
uh well ofcourse I can say that getting along with local students I'm not very good at it,nostress
I know that most international students here they don't get along with local students that well uh there are some students they are more international,stress
ofcourse it's easier,nostress
they have more things in common,nostress
I've been to Philipines for holiday before,nostress
I liked the beaches there,nostress
((My initial)) for after graduation would be to uh find -- find a place where I could do my graduate studies,nostress
if that doesn't turn out uh probably then I will probably do uh -- start finding a job,stress
um I have - haven't started looking for a job,nostress
I have been going to recruitment talks,stress
uh I haven't done any uh interviews,nostress
uh an uh,stress
I don't have any preparation,stress
uh I think it's actually hard to find job,nostress
the -- there is a lot of people who are much better suited to the type of jobs I'm -- I'm trying to look for,stress
uh I think my weaknesses would be my work experience,stress
also my internship experience,nostress
uh on other hand my professional knowledge,nostress
skills uh will compensate for that,nostress
also my communication skills will be a lot better,nostress
uh Have I got an offer? Yes uh I have had an my offer,nostress
uh it -- it is the one I wanted uh I wanted to go to ~U of ~T,nostress
uh What's my hardest uh place for studying I think the hardest would uh again be the mathematical side of everything,nostress
um ~PHD how long does it take to graduate? I think it would take around two years,stress
uh My friends don't really give me any pressure,nostress
I don't really compare myself with them,nostress
fro -- with my parents,nostress
they do expect a lot from me,nostress
also,nostress
they want me to major in things like finance,nostress
they think it's practical,stress
I know I'm not really good with numbers I'm scared to actually go into that area or to study it,nostress
other than like those academic things I -- they don't really give me ((them)) -- other kinds of pressure,stress
uh I get along with people quite well,nostress
like I normally just hang out with a few of my best friends i'm not like those kind of sociable person that like hang out with everybody,nostress
I kind of stick with um two or three best friends,nostress
I don't really talk to local people,nostress
most of people from hong kong they don't really have the same value as I did,nostress
like normally I don't talk to them,stress
like we're fine um I prefer my home town than Hong Kong somehow,stress
as I said more personal space,stress
everything's larger,nostress
I do like Hong Kong,nostress
um my parents did give me some pressure they -- they always ask me like what kind of grades did I get during the exams or stuff like that um yeah,stress
uh The -- the mo -- ah the most I'm worried about is uh for my final grade,stress
also about uh my -- my future prospects,stress
I'm not sure exactly right now wether I'm going to be joining a workforce or wether I'll be continuing my further studies,stress
Um I'm really busy at the moment I've got lots of homeworks,nostress
assignment submissions,stress
I have a -- I have like assi -- I have almost two assignment submissions every week um I particularly find uh the electronics course's assignments the most difficult,stress
they involve a lot of thought,stress
lot of energy,nostress
I'm in my second year at the moment,nostress
it will take me two years more to graduate,nostress
Uh I've not begun writing any paper as of now,nostress
Um <comma> I have exams in like two or three weeks time uh,nostress
apart from that theres also a lot of homework,stress
other stuff,stress
I like vegetable alot um i heard people talking about like they can't really live without meat for like a week,nostress
i do -- i can do that for like quite long time um I recommend avocado sandwich in cafeteria in our school which is like the best avocado sandwich i had,nostress
My parents are really open minded,nostress
like they don't really care what I'm doing as long as I like what I'm doing,nostress
they don't really give me any pressure <comma> my friends um most of them are fine they're like timid,nostress
shy,stress
i do have a few friends that is like ((very sparkling)),nostress
try to like push me to do a lot of things,stress
like i don't really hang out with them,nostress
i think that's fine,nostress
