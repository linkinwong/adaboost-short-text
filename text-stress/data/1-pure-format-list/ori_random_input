your interests are the same
in university you learn about things that you -- that you would never ever have know before
uh How I get along with local students I suppose I get on better -- get along better with them than other internationals
I was born here

uh What -- what i would recommend is -- is a holiday in South Africa definately uh anybody whose been to South Africa on -- o -- on holiday really really love it

they recommend it to everybody else
Anywhere worth going well I'd say that Cape town is the -- is the heart of tourism in South Africa
right now I prefer -- I prefer my home town

My plan after graduation is ofcourse take some time off uh absorb everything in that I graduated
that I'm ready for the working environment I'll go take a big trip with my family
my friends just before I start working
basically um get in the mood to -- to work in real life
I've been looking for jobs uh been going through job ~DB's , newspapers
through my parents
um it's coming pretty good I've sent around fifty uh copies of resumes to companies
I've got interview offers from six of them,
without preparing about well tell you what it's all about looking up the company websites updating -- updated on the news of what's happening, press conferences, etc
Uh it's uh pretty hard to find a job um
specially in Hong Kong it's such a competetive market
everyones looking for jobs the unemployment rate is pretty high
it's just you know it's hard
Well my weaknesses, um, I think my weakness is my communication skills since I don't like listening to people
I like doing stuff myself
yeah I can -- I can learn from my weakness I mean I can change to more communication, more effective communication to understand other people's perspectives
hopefully that will um -- that can apply to my real job sooner or later
Well after I finish uh graduating first honors in my class uh @UPENN
Harvard offered me uh post graduate position
I just -- you know I told them no
I want more life experience
I'm pretty sick of studying in just a faculty or anything
I want to go out there reach out to the community what they gave me when I was young
uh yeah that's my reason for rejecting these top universities
When it comes to studying, well what I think is hardest ofcourse I think that absorbing all the knowledge
--
uh material is pretty hard
I think applying the real material to real life situations
scenarios is the hardest it's not going to get harder than that
the environment keeps changing
the textbook might not really apply
you have to use your common sense, etc
yup I made think -- I made my point
How long does it take to graduate, wow that's -- that's a hard question um I think um it really depends on how much you are willing to devote your life to studying for your ~PHD
I mean that is the last level in -- uh in terms of academics
I would yeah yeah

um I have - haven't started looking for a job
I have been going to recruitment talks
uh I haven't done any uh interviews
uh an uh
I don't have any preparation
uh I think it's actually hard to find job
the -- there is a lot of people who are much better suited to the type of jobs I'm -- I'm trying to look for
uh I think my weaknesses would be my work experience
also my internship experience
uh on other hand my professional knowledge
skills uh will compensate for that
also my communication skills will be a lot better
uh Have I got an offer? Yes uh I have had an my offer
uh it -- it is the one I wanted uh I wanted to go to ~U of ~T
uh What's my hardest uh place for studying I think the hardest would uh again be the mathematical side of everything

What courses I think are the most difficult uh well I think what -- what courses I find easier than others are courses where it -- where it requires more understanding I suppose

wrong answer
the courses that I find more -- to be more difficult I think would be those that require a definite answer the more quan -- quantitative subjects
