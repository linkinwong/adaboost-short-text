it involves a lot of lot of math,stress
Recent work is not going very good since I've no motivation to start studyin,stress
my midterms is coming soon,stress
i'll study soon,stress
ah The course I think the most difficult is um Accounting,stress
Finance <comma> cause I’m in Finance major,nostress
I have to do Accounting again,nostress
it’s really boring,nostress
I feel really stressed every time I ((need to do)) study,stress
What I'm actually anxious about for the moment uh is my academic life,nostress
That's the most important thing,nostress
uh,nostress
maybe uh when we are talking about relationship,nostress
love life <comma> that will probably come later,stress
Recent work is uh hard to focus on,stress
um job applications are taking -- is taking up,stress
much time <comma> uh making it hard to focus on current work,stress
um Actually my parents <comma> they dont give me any pressure at all which I think is pretty odd for most Asian people I know that a lot of them they have a lot of pressure from home,nostress
I know my mom she can -- she just says that if you don't like university you can come back any time you don't even have to finish graduation I don't give a shit,nostress
So <comma> no pressure at all,nostress
I'm anxious about my academic life <comma> employment,stress
relationships,stress
empolyment is hard to look for right now relationshps is also hard,stress
academic life is something I can do,stress
I just don't feel like doing right now,nostress
No man,nostress
I haven't seen any good movies lately,nostress
I've been stuck in the library revising,nostress
That sounds (()) -- sounds pretty boring,stress
hey that's year two you know,stress
Yup that basically sums up my movie life,nostress
I've been to ((ho)) um Europe,nostress
places in Asia like India,nostress
Thailand,nostress
uh Where do I plan to go um Europe -- I'm going to exchange for Europe again,nostress
this time hopefully I'll actually remember things,nostress
I went last time when I was really really young,nostress
I like uh Oslo <comma> my home town,nostress
uh I can recommend going to see the Opera <comma> it’s the biggest one in Europe,nostress
I'd say overall university,stress
far has been better,nostress
at the end of high school I had really good friends as well,nostress
I think as far as friends go I've been pretty lucky,nostress
enjoying myself,nostress
The previous holiday I travelled around china quite extensively we -- we went all around China we went to Mongolia <comma> uh ((xing xiao)) <comma> uh Beijing <comma> uh lots of places,nostress
after that I went back to South Africa where my parents are,nostress
s --,nostress
I went home for the holidays also -- um What did I like about the place well firstly South Africa is home,nostress
uh,nostress
th -- th -- that in itself says a lot,nostress
what I like about China was that well it's -- it's -- it's there's a sense of familiarity,nostress
I -- I speak chinese,stress
a lot of my relatives are in China,nostress
when -- when I go there it feels more familiar then for example Hong Kong where everybody speaks cantonese,nostress
When i'm free i cook a lot <comma> like i do like the food i cook,nostress
--,nostress
i do like create some new food that others did not cook,nostress
um I like ((it)),nostress
my mum like the stuff i cooked,stress
my dad like it as well i don't like it that much,nostress
they like it,nostress
For my leisure time I like watching movies or TV shows or sometimes I also like to play the violin,nostress
it relaxes me,nostress
that's what I want for my lesiure time,nostress
My parents give me a lot of pressure,stress
uh My mother wants me to move back to Europe after graduation uh which is also something I have to take into account for employment issues,stress
The most recent tv show I watched is gossip girl,nostress
it's about four people <comma> young people fighting all the time,nostress
my favourite type of tv series is drama,nostress
um I think finance,stress
accounting courses are the most difficult,nostress
it requires a lot of application,stress
a lot of theories,stress
I've been to Philipines for holiday before,nostress
I liked the beaches there,nostress
I -- I would be lying if I say I don't get any pressure from my parents uh they -- they really --,nostress
it's -- it's the sort of pressure which like -- it's always in a positive sense,nostress
They -- they want me to work hard,nostress
that I can uh have a good life,nostress
I don't have troubles later on,nostress
I like my college life,nostress
I'm adapting pretty fast I'm a fast adapter,nostress
I came to this university,nostress
it's close to mainland China,nostress
I live there,nostress
I study business,nostress
I've no idea what I want to do,nostress
business is the safest option,nostress
My home town is wu han in mainland china I like um -- the food there is very special um it's nice um hot dry noodles it's very good,nostress
um The place that's worth going is the east lake ah it's very -- it's a natural place very nice I prefer it -- I prefer my home town to hong kong,nostress
it's still my home town where I grew up yeah the all the people,nostress
places,nostress
I like uh Thai food <comma> uh Thai cuisine is probably my favorite,nostress
Uh I have a restaurant in Hang Hau Tsuen where I usually go for Thai food,nostress
I enjoy it a lot,nostress
uh I think I'm adapting to college life pretty well,nostress
I've been a student for quite some time now,nostress
I mean most people here actually very nice,nostress
it's not that hard to adapt well,nostress
why did I come to this university well I lived in Shanghai before,nostress
in hong kong they have very good universities,nostress
uh yeah I guess that's pretty much the reason,nostress
Well compared to high school university socialsing I suppose is a lot a lot better,nostress
y -- the people you meet are,nostress
much more varied you meet people from all walks of life that you would never have gotten a chance to know in high school,nostress
in high school uh your friends are all -- all come from very similar background,nostress
--,nostress
your interests are the same,nostress
in university you learn about things that you -- that you would never ever have know before,nostress
uh How I get along with local students I suppose I get on better -- get along better with them than other internationals,nostress
I was born here,nostress
I can -- I can understand cantonese,nostress
I speak mandarin,nostress
still not to not to a very satisfactory extent,nostress
um I can -- I can -- I can speak to them,stress
uh none of them are my close friends uh none of my close friends are locals,nostress
in a -- in a way it's difficult to uh properly bond with them,nostress
Well I was born in Hong Kong technically,nostress
I think of Cape town <comma> South Africa as my home town,nostress
specialities in South Africa wud -- that would definately be um wine,nostress
Wine is the big export of South Africa as well as -- w -- we eat alot of meat the -- the -- the stereotype about south african males is that they -- they barbeque a lot of meat although we don't call it barbeque we call it braai,nostress
uh What -- what i would recommend is -- is a holiday in South Africa definately uh anybody whose been to South Africa on -- o -- on holiday really really love it,nostress
--,nostress
they recommend it to everybody else,nostress
Anywhere worth going well I'd say that Cape town is the -- is the heart of tourism in South Africa,nostress
right now I prefer -- I prefer my home town,nostress
whenever --,nostress
you always want what you can't have,nostress
when I'm in South Africa I think about my friends in Hong Kong,nostress
when I'm in Hong Kong I think about home,nostress
my parents are in South Africa,nostress
--,nostress
you always miss going home on the weekend,nostress
uh For me in university I would say that any course involving numbers are the most difficult,stress
I suck at math,stress
uh What kind of food do I like well I -- I -- I don't discriminate I love all -- all types of food,nostress
just anything except spicy food <comma> I can't take any spice at all,stress
any recommendation I like,nostress
Well I suppose um I prefer ((huh)) uh ordering for yourself instead of -- instead of what they do in china,nostress
what they do in a lot of places in asia where they order for the table,nostress
everybody shares um ((huh)) I -- I -- I like just one plate for me,nostress
one plate for -- for somebody else um,stress
I suppose I prefer western food as opposed to chinese food having grown up in South Africa,nostress
I do not know how to make it um,nostress
um I just never learnt to cook,nostress
my mother can't cook either,nostress
((huh)) uh,nostress
I had nowhere to learn it from,nostress
I do know where to get it definately in restaurants,nostress
in supermarkets,nostress
um Recently I have a lot of presentations,nostress
projects which I need to work upon,nostress
The mec- mechanical courses actually um are the toughest for me,nostress
they involve a lot of thinking,stress
I have -- It's my second year,nostress
I have two more years to graduate,nostress
uh I have my exams like after two weeks,nostress
I need to put in a lot of effort to (( )) well in them,stress
I n/a have a lot of homework <comma> too,stress
I like -- I like pizza,nostress
uh you can basically put any kind of topping on it,nostress
it taste delicious,nostress
uh I do know how to make it <comma> you just need dough,nostress
some ingredients,nostress
uh I don't think I did as well com -- uh compared to high school,stress
uh during high school a lot of us came from the same background,stress
a lot of us were uh Chinese people,nostress
then we lived abroad,stress
then we came back,nostress
the loose -- local students are -- I'm starting to get used to them,nostress
uh I'm starting to get along with them,nostress
uh I think uh I have somewhat integrated into Hong Kong society,nostress
I do prefer a place that has more English culture,stress
Yeah my favorite past time is playing football <comma> I like it,nostress
of Cristiano Ronaldo,nostress
My parents are really open minded,nostress
like they don't really care what I'm doing as long as I like what I'm doing,nostress
they don't really give me any pressure <comma> my friends um most of them are fine they're like timid,nostress
shy,stress
i do have a few friends that is like ((very sparkling)),nostress
try to like push me to do a lot of things,stress
like i don't really hang out with them,nostress
i think that's fine,nostress
I get along well with other people in university not mainly locals,nostress
mainlanders,nostress
definately international people,nostress
uh My friends don't really give me any pressure,nostress
I don't really compare myself with them,nostress
fro -- with my parents,nostress
they do expect a lot from me,nostress
also,nostress
they want me to major in things like finance,nostress
they think it's practical,stress
I know I'm not really good with numbers I'm scared to actually go into that area or to study it,nostress
other than like those academic things I -- they don't really give me ((them)) -- other kinds of pressure,stress
um The closest deadline I have to catch is the deadline for my uh ~PG course,stress
I have to send in a ten page written report,stress
I find the finance classes to be the most difficult,nostress
of the quantitative aspect,stress
