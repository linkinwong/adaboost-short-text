Okay<comma>nostress
I watched a movie called Machete<comma>nostress
uh Its actually a really good its kind of violent<comma>nostress
if you are sensitive I would not really recommend it<comma>nostress
for anyone else i -- if you want an enjoyable movie I think you should really watch it<comma>nostress
um Recently I have a lot of presentations<comma>nostress
projects which I need to work upon<comma>nostress
The mec- mechanical courses actually um are the toughest for me<comma>nostress
they involve a lot of thinking<comma>stress
I have -- It's my second year<comma>nostress
I have two more years to graduate<comma>nostress
uh I have my exams like after two weeks<comma>nostress
I need to put in a lot of effort to (( )) well in them<comma>stress
I n/a have a lot of homework<comma> too<comma>stress
Recently I've seen a movie called Inception<comma>nostress
It's a thriller n/a<comma>nostress
my favorite types of movies are comedies<comma>nostress
thrillers<comma>nostress
Yeah I like Indian food a lot um<comma>nostress
it's got a lot of flavor <comma> it's really spicy<comma>nostress
good to eat<comma>nostress
I don't know how to make it<comma>nostress
I know places from where I can get it<comma>nostress
uh last week I saw the movie Inception<comma> which was a very good movie starring Leonardo DiCaprio which is uh about stealing other people's uh dreams<comma>nostress
planting ideas<comma>nostress
It’s the first movie that talks about lucid dreaming<comma>nostress
Uh I think I get along pretty good with people here I mean compared to high school ofcourse these guys are more mature<comma>nostress
uh at the same time there is more diverse cultures here<comma>nostress
you can uh  -- you can share your experieces<comma> your food<comma> your cultures<comma> etc<comma>nostress
When it comes to local students they are a bit hard to get in touch to<comma>nostress
they already have their group of friends<comma>stress
--<comma>nostress
I try -- I try integrating into Hong Kong societies -- uh local society by joining their events etc<comma>nostress
Recent work is uh hard to focus on<comma>stress
um job applications are taking -- is taking up<comma>stress
much time<comma> uh making it hard to focus on current work<comma>stress
Well compared to high school university socialsing I suppose is a lot a lot better<comma>nostress
y -- the people you meet are<comma>nostress
much more varied you meet people from all walks of life that you would never have gotten a chance to know in high school<comma>nostress
in high school uh your friends are all -- all come from very similar background<comma>nostress
--<comma>nostress
your interests are the same<comma>nostress
in university you learn about things that you -- that you would never ever have know before<comma>nostress
uh How I get along with local students I suppose I get on better -- get along better with them than other internationals<comma>nostress
I was born here<comma>nostress
I can -- I can understand cantonese<comma>nostress
I speak mandarin<comma>nostress
still not to not to a very satisfactory extent<comma>nostress
um I can -- I can -- I can speak to them<comma>stress
uh none of them are my close friends uh none of my close friends are locals<comma>nostress
in a -- in a way it's difficult to uh properly bond with them<comma>nostress
What courses I think are the most difficult uh well I think what -- what courses I find easier than others are courses where it -- where it requires more understanding I suppose<comma>nostress
where the exams are not simply true or false or multiple choice where you can um -- where you can explain your reasoning<comma>nostress
then the -- there isn't really a -- a definite right<comma>nostress
wrong answer<comma>nostress
the courses that I find more -- to be more difficult I think would be those that require a definite answer the more quan -- quantitative subjects<comma>nostress
I've been to Europe for holiday half a year ago um I've been to like Greece<comma> Italy<comma>nostress
Spain<comma>nostress
um I like the place<comma>nostress
it has totally different ah culture<comma> background<comma>nostress
it's very nice to see the beautiful views<comma>nostress
At the moment<comma> um one thing I am very anxious about is going -- going to army<comma> of course<comma>stress
that totally you know ruins everything<comma>stress
Uh I don't really -- I'm not really worried about uh employment or academic life<comma>stress
it is mostly about my future<comma>nostress
Um my hometown is Seoul<comma> Korea<comma>nostress
Um I recommend ah you go to eat some Korean food in Seoul<comma>nostress
There many new Korean restaurants<comma>nostress
Um you can also go to some old palaces to -- to see traditional stuff about Korea<comma>nostress
I prefer my hometown over Hong Kong<comma><comma>nostress
you know it is my country<comma>nostress
I feel more comfortable there<comma>nostress
uh Yes my parents gave me a lot of pressure<comma>stress
I'm the only child in the family<comma>stress
they have a lot of expectations on me<comma>stress
also my friends gave me a little bit pressure that's called peer pressure ((yea))<comma>stress
I try to deal with that right now<comma>stress
um im more anxious about my maybe love life<comma>nostress
im being quite busy with my academic life<comma>stress
i haven't devote much of time like relationship stuff like that<comma>stress
yeah<comma>stress
I'm adapting pretty good to college life um friends are good here the environment is really good<comma> beautiful view<comma>nostress
I in the end I chose marketing<comma>nostress
finance as my major<comma>nostress
um The food I like most is ah tr -- traditional cantonese soup um it's -- it's the kind of food that you have uh -- the soup that you have to make it for like two hours or<comma>nostress
I like it even the one in our university canteen um I don't know how to make it<comma>nostress
it's really complicated<comma>nostress
i can really buy -- i can buy it in the restaurants<comma>nostress
ah My home town is Beijing um there's nothing really special about it<comma> just the capital city of china I recommend people to go to the great wall<comma> the tiananmen square um probably that's it for beijing<comma>nostress
I -- I prefer Beijing than Hong Kong<comma>nostress
it's bigger<comma>nostress
people do get like more personal space than Hong Kong<comma>nostress
Yeah I've been to -- been for a holiday in Goa<comma> it's a place in India -- uh a beach place in India<comma>nostress
I like the place um<comma>nostress
of the beach<comma>nostress
the girls<comma>nostress
everything<comma>nostress
Um<comma> in the university I'm actually most anxious about my academic life<comma>nostress
uh I really want to do well<comma>stress
that later on I can get a good job over here<comma>stress
have a good future<comma>nostress
Um<comma> when it comes to life I'm anxious about everything<comma>nostress
you don't know what is going to happen you can't predict the outcome<comma>stress
here it asks me employment academic life relationship love life<comma> ofcourse I'm nervous about that who isn't<comma>nostress
College life is uh easy to adapt to<comma>nostress
um It’s more the academic side of it that’s a little bit challenging<comma>nostress
the social side is uh liberating<comma>stress
Yeah my favorite past time is playing football<comma> I like it<comma>nostress
of Cristiano Ronaldo<comma>nostress
Ah recently I’ve seen this Korean ah ~TV show which is called super star K<comma>nostress
it's like American idol<comma>nostress
It’s like a singing contest<comma>nostress
Well<comma> uh I do a lot of activities for leisure like surfing the Internet<comma> playing a lot of games like badminton<comma>nostress
table tennis<comma>nostress
um I think communications play a very important role in helping me to get along with other people uh you need to express yourself very clearly<comma>nostress
try to understand others uh from their perspective -- um compared to high school I think I prefer college life<comma>nostress
the way people try to get along with each other here -- um I get along pretty well with local students<comma>nostress
I speak Cantonese natively<comma>nostress
I think I would have not that many difficulties in intergrating into Hong Kong society um<comma>nostress
definately I prefer Hong Kong over my home town<comma>nostress
this is a more global society for me<comma>nostress
I meet different groups of people from everywhere<comma>nostress
I think I have a lot of close friends uh since I came to Hong Kong<comma>nostress
Ah i think the most difficult course right now for like these 3 years are -- is machine learning I took that course for like three or four classes<comma>stress
i dropped it<comma>stress
I can't really understand what they're talking about in the class<comma>nostress
I think the most difficult courses are the ones that uh deal with a lot of equations a lot of different mathematical concepts<comma>nostress
The reason is uh I think my skill set would be more of uh dealing with uh concepts instead of mathematical models<comma>nostress
um I'm not picky as long as it's vegeterian food uh pizza<comma> pasta<comma> indian food anything does<comma>nostress
uh How do I get along with other people well I guess you should be asking other people that question uh I think I get along with other people okay most of the time<comma>nostress
I'm pretty sure that it's getting better all the time<comma>nostress
every time you meet someone new you learn more about it<comma>nostress
uh well ofcourse I can say that getting along with local students I'm not very good at it<comma>nostress
I know that most international students here they don't get along with local students that well uh there are some students they are more international<comma>stress
ofcourse it's easier<comma>nostress
they have more things in common<comma>nostress
I've been to Philipines for holiday before<comma>nostress
I liked the beaches there<comma>nostress
((My initial)) for after graduation would be to uh find -- find a place where I could do my graduate studies<comma>nostress
if that doesn't turn out uh probably then I will probably do uh -- start finding a job<comma>stress
um I have - haven't started looking for a job<comma>nostress
I have been going to recruitment talks<comma>stress
uh I haven't done any uh interviews<comma>nostress
uh an uh<comma>stress
I don't have any preparation<comma>stress
uh I think it's actually hard to find job<comma>nostress
the -- there is a lot of people who are much better suited to the type of jobs I'm -- I'm trying to look for<comma>stress
uh I think my weaknesses would be my work experience<comma>stress
also my internship experience<comma>nostress
uh on other hand my professional knowledge<comma>nostress
skills uh will compensate for that<comma>nostress
also my communication skills will be a lot better<comma>nostress
uh Have I got an offer? Yes uh I have had an my offer<comma>nostress
uh it -- it is the one I wanted uh I wanted to go to ~U of ~T<comma>nostress
uh What's my hardest uh place for studying I think the hardest would uh again be the mathematical side of everything<comma>nostress
um ~PHD how long does it take to graduate? I think it would take around two years<comma>stress
uh My friends don't really give me any pressure<comma>nostress
I don't really compare myself with them<comma>nostress
fro -- with my parents<comma>nostress
they do expect a lot from me<comma>nostress
also<comma>nostress
they want me to major in things like finance<comma>nostress
they think it's practical<comma>stress
I know I'm not really good with numbers I'm scared to actually go into that area or to study it<comma>nostress
other than like those academic things I -- they don't really give me ((them)) -- other kinds of pressure<comma>stress
uh I get along with people quite well<comma>nostress
like I normally just hang out with a few of my best friends i'm not like those kind of sociable person that like hang out with everybody<comma>nostress
I kind of stick with um two or three best friends<comma>nostress
I don't really talk to local people<comma>nostress
most of people from hong kong they don't really have the same value as I did<comma><comma>nostress
like normally I don't talk to them<comma>stress
like we're fine um I prefer my home town than Hong Kong somehow<comma>stress
as I said more personal space<comma>stress
everything's larger<comma>nostress
I do like Hong Kong<comma>nostress
um my parents did give me some pressure they -- they always ask me like what kind of grades did I get during the exams or stuff like that um yeah<comma>stress
uh The -- the mo -- ah the most I'm worried about is uh for my final grade<comma>stress
also about uh my -- my future prospects<comma>stress
I'm not sure exactly right now wether I'm going to be joining a workforce or wether I'll be continuing my further studies<comma>stress
Um I'm really busy at the moment I've got lots of homeworks<comma>nostress
assignment submissions<comma>stress
I have a -- I have like assi -- I have almost two assignment submissions every week um I particularly find uh the electronics course's assignments the most difficult<comma>stress
they involve a lot of thought<comma>stress
lot of energy<comma>nostress
I'm in my second year at the moment<comma>nostress
it will take me two years more to graduate<comma>nostress
Uh I've not begun writing any paper as of now<comma>nostress
Um<comma> I have exams in like two or three weeks time uh<comma>nostress
apart from that theres also a lot of homework<comma>stress
other stuff<comma>stress
I like vegetable alot um i heard people talking about like they can't really live without meat for like a week<comma><comma>nostress
i do -- i can do that for like quite long time um I recommend avocado sandwich in cafeteria in our school which is like the best avocado sandwich i had<comma>nostress
My parents are really open minded<comma>nostress
like they don't really care what I'm doing as long as I like what I'm doing<comma>nostress
they don't really give me any pressure<comma> my friends um most of them are fine they're like timid<comma>nostress
shy<comma>stress
i do have a few friends that is like ((very sparkling))<comma>nostress
try to like push me to do a lot of things<comma>stress
like i don't really hang out with them<comma>nostress
i think that's fine<comma>nostress
I like my college life<comma>nostress
I'm adapting pretty fast I'm a fast adapter<comma>nostress
I came to this university<comma>nostress
it's close to mainland China<comma>nostress
I live there<comma>nostress
I study business<comma>nostress
I've no idea what I want to do<comma>nostress
business is the safest option<comma>nostress
uh In order to fulfill my um dreams<comma> I always wanted to do uh biomedical research<comma>nostress
In -- In order to do that I uh had to start with studying uh electronics<comma><comma>nostress
uh ~HKUST is very well known for uh electronic engineering<comma><comma>nostress
that's why I chose this university<comma>nostress
I think um college life is quite nice to me I came to this university in civil engineering major<comma>nostress
like I changed my major -- I changed my major in the middle of first year<comma>nostress
I took one electrical engineering course<comma>nostress
I got a+ from that course<comma>nostress
then right after I got my like A+ I changed to -- I switched to electrical engineering um I do like it<comma>nostress
--<comma>nostress
right now it's interesting I'm not sure after a while if it is still interesting or not<comma>nostress
My plan after graduation is to uh look for a job<comma> um<comma>stress
that I can pay uh for my bills<comma>nostress
I need to find a job<comma>stress
that’s uh very important for me<comma>nostress
Okay<comma> um<comma> I am looking for a job uh within the finance sector<comma>stress
I uh start doing my applications uh online this semester<comma>nostress
Application deadlines are very tense<comma>stress
I have to finish them within a month of my first uh semester of my final year<comma>stress
Further studies is something I’ve been thinking about doing two years after working<comma>stress
uh After working I will probably do the ~GMAT<comma>nostress
~GRE<comma> I have it in the back of my head<comma>nostress
I’m not doing it right now<comma>nostress
My parents don't actually put any pressure on me for study<comma>nostress
What they want is me -- they want me to do well in my studies<comma>nostress
that I have a bright future<comma> I have a better life<comma>stress
uh I think I get along with people quite well compared to highscool it's -- well I don't really compare them<comma>nostress
I can't say which one's better uh I guess I can get along with local students<comma>nostress
I don't really hang out with them I think I can integrate into Hong Kong society maybe<comma>nostress
I guess I'll always be the foreigner um I definately prefer Seoul than Hong Kong<comma>nostress
Hong -- I find Hong Kong too small<comma>nostress
crowded<comma>nostress
I do have close friends here<comma>nostress
uh What kind of food do I like well I -- I -- I don't discriminate I love all -- all types of food<comma>nostress
just anything except spicy food<comma> I can't take any spice at all<comma><comma>stress
any recommendation I like<comma>nostress
Well I suppose um I prefer ((huh)) uh ordering for yourself instead of -- instead of what they do in china<comma>nostress
what they do in a lot of places in asia where they order for the table<comma>nostress
everybody shares um ((huh)) I -- I -- I like just one plate for me<comma>nostress
one plate for -- for somebody else um<comma><comma>stress
I suppose I prefer western food as opposed to chinese food having grown up in South Africa<comma>nostress
I do not know how to make it um<comma>nostress
um I just never learnt to cook<comma>nostress
my mother can't cook either<comma>nostress
((huh)) uh<comma>nostress
I had nowhere to learn it from<comma>nostress
I do know where to get it definately in restaurants<comma>nostress
in supermarkets<comma>nostress
I'm from Shenzen my home town is Shenzen<comma>nostress
it's specialty is spa<comma>nostress
cheap fake goods<comma>nostress
I -- I really recommend Queens spa to go<comma>nostress
I prefer Hong Kong over my home town<comma>nostress
Hong Kong is more international<comma>nostress
I personally think that financing is one of the most difficult courses<comma>stress
I just hate numbers realistically<comma>stress
I just can't cope it when I see a large ba -- batch of numbers right in my face like I panic<comma>stress
freak out I don't know what to do<comma>stress
I get even more stressed than I am now<comma>stress
just sucks<comma> yeah<comma>stress
I'm not really that anxious about anything in particular um nothing really stands out just like regular problems<comma>stress
it's nothing major<comma>nostress
uh My home town is uh Tunisia<comma>nostress
the what I remin -- recommend to um uh strangers is to see uh couple of cities uh such as uh Bizerte<comma> Monastir<comma> Hammamet<comma>nostress
Nabeul<comma>nostress
If you enjoy the beach then you will have a very good time there<comma><comma>nostress
uh yes I do actually prefer Hong Kong than my -- my hometown<comma>nostress
uh life is much more easier here in a -- I like a country which offers a good service<comma>nostress
I'm more anxious about my finanical status<comma>stress
being an independent woman in such a materialistic society is not that easy<comma>stress
um My plan after graduation is to look for a job in um company like um -- which is generally related to automotive<comma>stress
after that I would p- pursue -- I would like to pursue my master's which could be in the US<comma>nostress
Huh<comma> well my hometown it's Hong Kong<comma>nostress
you know Hong Kong it's um really stressful<comma>nostress
look at ~US -- look at this uni<comma> Hong Kong University of Stress<comma>nostress
Tension<comma>stress
I mean I recommend everyone having a life<comma>stress
it's kind of hard when you have<comma>nostress
much work in university<comma>nostress
Uh<comma> if -- if you're asking me is there anywhere worth going I would say definitely Lang Kwai Fong to chill<comma>stress
you know remove your stress or whatever<comma>nostress
ofcourse I prefer Hong Kong my hometown<comma>nostress
I was born here<comma>nostress
raised here it's a great city to me<comma>nostress
you know you know what I mean<comma>nostress
I have been on holiday to Beijing<comma><comma>nostress
I like Beijing a lot<comma>nostress
it’s a lot cheaper than Hong Kong<comma>nostress
Hong Kong is a lot more expensive than Beijing<comma>nostress
Yeah my plan after graduation is to either work in some telecom firm or some firm dealing with microprocessors<comma>nostress
other stuff like that<comma>nostress
Uh<comma> for further study I would like to apply to some uh -- some graduate schools in the -- probably in the ~US or ~UK um I have still not got any offer as of now uh<comma>nostress
I wish to study over there<comma>nostress
The most recent tv show I watched is gossip girl<comma>nostress
it's about four people<comma> young people fighting all the time<comma>nostress
my favourite type of tv series is drama<comma>nostress
um My home town is Mumbai<comma>nostress
I like that it's really fast I recommend eating street foods there<comma> it's really good<comma>nostress
it's worth going to shopping places<comma>nostress
I prefer Mumbai<comma><comma>nostress
it's my home town<comma>nostress
I've been to quite a few places for holidays<comma>nostress
mostly in asia<comma>nostress
I like going on holidays<comma>nostress
it gives you a chance to just leave home<comma>nostress
be somewhere new<comma>nostress
then again I also like coming back home I don't want to stay on holiday forever<comma>nostress
lately I have been travelling to uh China<comma>nostress
uh I did not like anything about it except the uh travel I did in uh Lijiang<comma>nostress
I've been to Thailand before for holiday<comma>nostress
I like the food<comma>nostress
the beaches there<comma>nostress
Works going averagely<comma>stress
phsyics is um kind of difficult<comma>nostress
I'm really behind<comma>stress
I wasn't expecting it to be as hard<comma>nostress
I don't really have a concrete plan after graduation I think it will be a bit hard for me to find a job<comma>nostress
I don't really have any concrete work experience or internship experience<comma>nostress
i'm not too stressed about it right now<comma>nostress
for further study my parents want me to go to law school<comma>nostress
I guess I might be doing that as well<comma>nostress
nothing really definite or concrete as of yet<comma>nostress
um The closest deadline I have to catch is the deadline for my uh ~PG course<comma>stress
I have to send in a ten page written report<comma>stress
hmm What kind of things am I anxious about I'm not really anxious about employment yet<comma>nostress
I have atleast two more years of studying<comma>nostress
ofcourse sometimes I think about summer internships<comma>nostress
stuff<comma>nostress
I wouldn't really say I'm anxious about it<comma>nostress
Relationships<comma> love life<comma> well it's more the lack of love life that I am anxious about maybe<comma>nostress
I wouldn't use the word anxious I think it's a pretty strong word<comma>stress
Academic life<comma> not at all<comma> maybe ask me again one day before the mid-term<comma>nostress
right now not really<comma>nostress
My plan right after graduation is go on a three month -- atleast three month journey with my friends all around the world<comma>nostress
um Yes currently I'm looking for a graduation job<comma>nostress
far I haven't got any interview yet<comma>nostress
--<comma>stress
I think I'm well prepared for the interviews especially for the case crack for um consulting management firms --<comma>nostress
my weakness for uh looking for jobs I think it comes down to my academic record<comma>nostress
here in Hong Kong things are very competitive<comma>stress
people around me they're all having very good academic records<comma>stress
it's pretty hard to stand out in that sense<comma>nostress
um I probably don't want to study further I want to continue working here in Hong Kong<comma>stress
No<comma> my parents<comma>nostress
friends do not give me any pressure<comma>nostress
at the end of the day it's my life I make my own choices<comma>nostress
what -- uh<comma>nostress
I do get my own pressure for example just academic pressure or maybe pressure from peer pressure maybe or pressure from my girlfriend<comma>nostress
uh I manage to cope with it<comma>stress
I -- I cope<comma>nostress
Um<comma> I -- I've been to Bankok for the holiday<comma>nostress
I like that place<comma>nostress
it's good for shopping<comma> scenic beauty<comma><comma>nostress
it's got a lot of islands<comma>nostress
I get along with other people by um respecting other peoples habits or um attitudes an --<comma>nostress
stuff like that<comma>nostress
um I get along with local students by trying to speak their -- their language<comma>nostress
joining their activities<comma>nostress
um I intergrate into Hong Kong society by go to places where only local students usu -- local people usually go<comma>nostress
speaking their local language<comma>stress
also by taking one of the Hong Kong society courses<comma>nostress
I prefer my home town still<comma>nostress
I still like Hong Kong<comma> yup<comma>nostress
um I'm kind of anxious about my academic life<comma>stress
i'm applying for graduate school right now<comma>stress
like the offer thing didn't go very well I'm still waiting for that<comma>nostress
um I really don't know if I can get into one or two this year<comma>stress
im kind of nervous about that<comma>stress
think about that a lot um I'm trying to fix that<comma>stress
I'm not sure if that's going to happen<comma>stress
ah The course I think the most difficult is um Accounting<comma>stress
Finance<comma> cause I’m in Finance major<comma>nostress
I have to do Accounting again<comma>nostress
it’s really boring<comma>nostress
I feel really stressed every time I ((need to do)) study<comma>stress
My plan after graduation is ofcourse take some time off uh absorb everything in that I graduated<comma>nostress
that I'm ready for the working environment I'll go take a big trip with my family<comma>nostress
my friends just before I start working<comma>nostress
basically um get in the mood to -- to work in real life<comma>nostress
I've been looking for jobs uh been going through job ~DB's <comma> newspapers<comma>nostress
through my parents<comma>nostress
um it's coming pretty good I've sent around fifty uh copies of resumes to companies<comma>nostress
I've got interview offers from six of them<comma><comma>stress
without preparing about well tell you what it's all about looking up the company websites updating -- updated on the news of what's happening<comma> press conferences<comma> etc<comma>nostress
Uh it's uh pretty hard to find a job um<comma>nostress
specially in Hong Kong it's such a competetive market<comma>stress
everyones looking for jobs the unemployment rate is pretty high<comma>stress
it's just you know it's hard<comma>stress
Well my weaknesses<comma> um<comma> I think my weakness is my communication skills since I don't like listening to people<comma>stress
I like doing stuff myself<comma>stress
yeah I can -- I can learn from my weakness I mean I can change to more communication<comma> more effective communication to understand other people's perspectives<comma>nostress
hopefully that will um -- that can apply to my real job sooner or later<comma>nostress
Well after I finish uh graduating first honors in my class uh @UPENN<comma>nostress
Harvard offered me uh post graduate position<comma>nostress
I just -- you know I told them no<comma>nostress
I want more life experience<comma>nostress
I'm pretty sick of studying in just a faculty or anything<comma>nostress
I want to go out there reach out to the community what they gave me when I was young<comma>nostress
uh yeah that's my reason for rejecting these top universities<comma>stress
When it comes to studying<comma> well what I think is hardest ofcourse I think that absorbing all the knowledge<comma>nostress
--<comma>nostress
uh material is pretty hard<comma>stress
I think applying the real material to real life situations<comma>nostress
scenarios is the hardest it's not going to get harder than that<comma>stress
the environment keeps changing<comma>nostress
the textbook might not really apply<comma>stress
you have to use your common sense<comma> etc<comma>nostress
yup I made think -- I made my point<comma>nostress
How long does it take to graduate<comma> wow that's -- that's a hard question um I think um it really depends on how much you are willing to devote your life to studying for your ~PHD<comma>nostress
I mean that is the last level in -- uh in terms of academics<comma>stress
I would yeah yeah<comma>nostress
uh This summer I went to the Phillippines with a couple of friends<comma>nostress
We went to a place called Puerto Gelara its near Manila<comma>nostress
its a -- a really nice place ((actually))<comma>nostress
If you want to go there I recommend it<comma>nostress
Yes I have seen some good movies recently<comma> uh one them is about American History X<comma> uh my favourite type of movies are about dark humor<comma>nostress
um I really enjoy college life here<comma>nostress
I have a really good set of friends<comma> I came to UST<comma>nostress
it was pretty close to where my family's staying<comma>nostress
it -- the reputation is also quite good I decided to do -- uh do business<comma>nostress
my dad thought it would be a better choice than studying politics or a social science<comma>nostress
um I think the most difficult course I'm taking this semester is this econ course it's called industrial organisation<comma>nostress
competitor strategy<comma>nostress
it's difficult<comma>nostress
I don't like math<comma>nostress
it involves a lot of math<comma>stress
uh I think I'm adapting to college life pretty well<comma>nostress
I've been a student for quite some time now<comma>nostress
I mean most people here actually very nice<comma>nostress
it's not that hard to adapt well<comma>nostress
why did I come to this university well I lived in Shanghai before<comma>nostress
in hong kong they have very good universities<comma>nostress
uh yeah I guess that's pretty much the reason<comma>nostress
The course which I fin- find the most difficult in my n/a college are the o- mechanical core courses<comma>nostress
they req-require a lot of brainstorming<comma>stress
a lot of hard work to be put in<comma>nostress
Ah for my leisure I like to do sports<comma> like I like going gym or I like play -- playing football or tennis<comma>nostress
Ah That’s how I control -- how -- how I manage my stress level<comma>nostress
I'm in my second year now<comma>nostress
I've pretty much adapted to the college life<comma>nostress
uh I don't face any difficulties as such<comma>nostress
Um I came to this university<comma>nostress
obviously of the ranking um it has a really high rank among all the the colleges in the world<comma>nostress
I chose my major to study electronics as uh I've uh -- I've taken science in my high school<comma>nostress
that uh influenced my decision to take electronics for gra -- for graduatioin<comma>nostress
I like uh Thai food<comma> uh Thai cuisine is probably my favorite<comma>nostress
Uh I have a restaurant in Hang Hau Tsuen where I usually go for Thai food<comma>nostress
I enjoy it a lot<comma>nostress
um I think finance<comma>stress
accounting courses are the most difficult<comma>nostress
it requires a lot of application<comma>stress
a lot of theories<comma>stress
What I'm actually anxious about for the moment uh is my academic life<comma>nostress
That's the most important thing<comma>nostress
uh<comma>nostress
maybe uh when we are talking about relationship<comma>nostress
love life<comma> that will probably come later<comma>stress
uh How I'm adapting to college life well this is -- this is very multi-layered I suppose uh I'm adjusting well I'm -- I've -- I've made a lot of new friends<comma>nostress
they're all very very nice<comma>nostress
a lot of them are mostly superifical friends<comma>nostress
-- sort of not superficial as in like they're very materialistic<comma>stress
just -- just hi bye friends ones that you say hi to<comma>stress
that --<comma>nostress
that you speak to for a little while<comma>nostress
um<comma>nostress
mostly it's very -- Hong Kong's very different to South Africa I mean my parents are in South Africa<comma>nostress
if I had stayed in university in South Africa it would have been a lot different to -- to right now<comma>nostress
now I'm staying in university -- I'm staying on a whole different continent from my parents<comma>nostress
there's a lot of independence there's a lot of freedom<comma>nostress
--<comma>nostress
that takes getting used to for a while<comma>nostress
uh I came to this university<comma>stress
my parents -- my parents wanted me to<comma> again -- uh<comma>nostress
my parents -- i was born in Hong Kong<comma>nostress
my parents are from China<comma>nostress
in the end they want me -- they would like me to work in -- in China or -- or -- in -- in Hong Kong one day<comma>nostress
they think that to study in the country that your going to work in has lots of benefits<comma>stress
that's why they sent me to Hong Kong to study --<comma>nostress
why I chose my major (())well again my parents thought that uh business<comma>nostress
w -- well especially the global business program is the best in th -- the business field in -- in ~HKUST<comma>nostress
in Hong Kong<comma>nostress
that's why my major right now is global business<comma>nostress
My hometown is Jaipur<comma>nostress
Uh it has got a lot of n/a traditional dances<comma>nostress
it's make clothes<comma>nostress
I would recommend people to go to my city<comma>nostress
it's very beautiful it's called the pink city n/a of India<comma>nostress
I would prefer to my hometown on Hong Kong<comma>nostress
of the brotherhood<comma>nostress
the culture there<comma>nostress
The most recent TV series that -- the most recent good TV series that I've watched has been uh definately the new gossip girl the last season of gossip girl<comma><comma>nostress
of well very little people like to admit it<comma>nostress
it's a -- it's -- it's sort of a sinful pleasure<comma>nostress
of all the drama<comma>nostress
people --<comma>nostress
people really indulge in uh seeing other people suffer in a way it's -- it's human nature<comma>nostress
um people -- people ar -- are a little bit ashamed of -- of loving gossip girl<comma>nostress
much<comma>stress
I'm -- I'm not ashamed of that at all um my favourite type of movies or TV series preferably not the -- the blockbuster action type<comma>nostress
more uh with more drama<comma>nostress
with more sentimentality<comma>nostress
uh What I like to do for lesiure<comma> surfing the internet of course y -- you can't be at @HKUST without uh learning<comma>nostress
much more about the internet about what websites to go to about where to watch movies<comma> where to watch tv series --<comma>nostress
also sports definately um my parents were -- are big sports people<comma>nostress
from -- from when I was young I've played a lot of sports<comma>nostress
that<comma>nostress
also listening to music<comma>nostress
I get along well with other people in university not mainly locals<comma>nostress
mainlanders<comma>nostress
definately international people<comma>nostress
Um my home town is uh South Africa<comma> uh um it's a little town called uh called N- uh New Castle<comma>nostress
uh The speciality I'd say was uh in South Africa is Biltong<comma>nostress
uh I'll definately recommend it<comma>nostress
it's really tasty<comma>nostress
um I found accounting the most difficult out of them all I just didn't understand it at all um more difficult than finance<comma>stress
For leisure<comma> I like uh surfing<comma> um I also like hiking<comma> Hong Kong is perfect for that<comma>nostress
See usually I do a lot of sports<comma>  uh I hike uh trails to uh -- to go to the beach Tai Long Wan uh to surf<comma>nostress
Um I’m doing good in college<comma>nostress
I have made a lot of friends<comma>nostress
Ah I have chosen to come to this university<comma>nostress
um it is more cheaper than ah other schools in ~US or ~UK<comma>nostress
Um<comma>nostress
also I got scholarship as well<comma>nostress
I decided to come here<comma>nostress
Um<comma>nostress
I chose um finance<comma>nostress
~OM<comma>nostress
I like -- I like these subject<comma>nostress
That is how I chose my subject<comma>nostress
uh The reason work has been going well for me I haven't got any deadline to catch yet --<comma>nostress
um there's one course called uh derivative I think it's a little difficult<comma>nostress
I just need to read through the textbook((s)) --<comma>stress
it will take uh approximately nine months for me to graduate<comma>nostress
I don't have to write a paper<comma>nostress
no difficulty for that<comma>nostress
no recent exams um<comma>nostress
I don't have that much homework they are pretty simple<comma>nostress
I find the finance classes to be the most difficult<comma>nostress
of the quantitative aspect<comma>stress
the competition within the class from other students<comma>nostress
After graduation I -- I wanna look for a job<comma>stress
right now it's not going very well<comma>nostress
I'm sure in 3rd year it will be better<comma>stress
I don't have an inteview on going recently<comma>nostress
after a couple of years of experience I do wanna do MBA in United States --<comma>stress
my weakness would probably be my lack of work experience in my resume<comma>nostress
I do have good communication skills<comma>stress
uh In my free time I'm mostly like going out getting drunk<comma>nostress
life in ~UST kind of sucks most of the time<comma>nostress
once in a while it is nice to have a cold one<comma>stress
just relax<comma>nostress
My father actually gives me a lot of pressure<comma>stress
uh he wants me to do as good as uh he did when he was a student<comma>stress
I think ah uh initially I adapted very poorly to college life<comma>stress
I didn't know a lot of people<comma>stress
I really didn't embrace the Cantonese culture<comma>nostress
The reason why I chose this university is<comma>stress
I know that ~UST is very good in its technological side<comma>nostress
uh --<comma>stress
also uh why did I come to Hong Kong is<comma>nostress
uh um I had a financial difficulty with my family<comma>nostress
if I stayed in Hong Kong it would be a lot cheaper<comma>stress
My parents give me a lot of pressure<comma>stress
uh My mother wants me to move back to Europe after graduation uh which is also something I have to take into account for employment issues<comma>stress
um I've seen a good movie called um the inception its -- its about the dream<comma>nostress
scien -- scientifc stuff actually um this -- my favourite type of movie is about like love<comma>nostress
romance<comma>nostress
uh Currently I’m very anxious about several things<comma>nostress
uh Number one being employment after graduation<comma>stress
  Secondly<comma> it’s the academics uh I’m also worried about<comma>nostress
What my grade average will be<comma> which will again limit the employ -employment options<comma>stress
uh Relationships is also something I think about<comma>stress
For my leisure time I like watching movies or TV shows or sometimes I also like to play the violin<comma>nostress
it relaxes me<comma>nostress
that's what I want for my lesiure time<comma>nostress
When i'm free i cook a lot<comma> like i do like the food i cook<comma>nostress
--<comma>nostress
i do like create some new food that others did not cook<comma>nostress
um I like ((it))<comma>nostress
my mum like the stuff i cooked<comma>stress
my dad like it as well i don't like it that much<comma>nostress
they like it<comma>nostress
Well<comma> as I have made a lot of friends in my university its easy to get along with people<comma>nostress
I think uh its better gi --  here in my university than in my high school<comma>nostress
I have friends from all different parts of the world<comma>nostress
Its quite difficult to get along with the local students<comma>nostress
there's a communication problem<comma>stress
if when you -- when you like (()) in the university for quite long its -- its used to for you<comma>nostress
Its always very difficult for me to integrate in the Hong Kong society<comma>nostress
of their culture -- cultural<comma>stress
the rituals<comma><comma>nostress
its very difficult to choose from in between my Hong -- uh hometown<comma>nostress
Hong Kong<comma>stress
every place has it's own value<comma>nostress
different criterias<comma>nostress
Yeah I've started to get along with all the people over here<comma>stress
Um<comma> both the international students as well as the local students<comma>nostress
Uh<comma> the local students initially I found it hard to talk to them<comma>nostress
uh slowly<comma>nostress
slowly due -- due to like cultural events<comma>nostress
all other stuff I got mixed with these people<comma>nostress
enjoyed a lot<comma>nostress
Between my hometown<comma>nostress
Hong Kong uh it's really tough to choose which one I would prefer<comma>nostress
I like all the aspects of the places<comma>stress
I have really close friends over here<comma>nostress
they help me a lot<comma>nostress
I like to go into the city<comma>nostress
just walk randomly for leisure or I like to sleep<comma>nostress
it's relaxing<comma>nostress
uh<comma>stress
my recent work is actually not going that well<comma>nostress
its the beginning of the semester its always hard to get start again after the summer<comma>stress
Well talking about food I mean I used to eat healthy<comma>nostress
stuff when I had the time<comma>nostress
money<comma>nostress
now I have no time<comma>nostress
I'm always stuck in the library<comma>stress
I've been eating really unhealthy<comma>stress
getting fat<comma><comma>nostress
um when it comes to recommendations I would definitely recommend Indian food well<comma>stress
I -- I can take spice<comma>nostress
I love the flavor<comma><comma>nostress
right now I've been really unhealthy<comma>nostress
stuffing myself with McDonald's<comma>nostress
yeah it's not good<comma>nostress
Uh holidays<comma> well sounds like ages since I've been on a really nice holiday<comma> uh<comma> I think it was around two years ago I went on a holiday to the Medi -- Mediterranean<comma>nostress
Man I really -- I really really liked that place the girls everything the food it was great<comma>nostress
now I mean I guess I need to concentrate on my studies<comma>nostress
you know no trips for me<comma>nostress
I've been to ((ho)) um Europe<comma>nostress
places in Asia like India<comma>nostress
Thailand<comma>nostress
uh Where do I plan to go um Europe -- I'm going to exchange for Europe again<comma>nostress
this time hopefully I'll actually remember things<comma>nostress

uh I would say that my two favorites cousines in the world would be maybe Italian<comma>nostress
Thai food or yeah actually I like Indian food a lot as well<comma>nostress
uh Yes I have seen uh some ~TV series lately<comma>nostress
It's How I Met Your Mother<comma> it was about uh -- it was about ted<comma>nostress
((me ah)) -- him trying to meet his uh -- his -- his wife<comma><comma>nostress
tyring to get a girlfriend<comma>nostress
um i think the math course is the most difficult<comma>stress
um im not good at math<comma>stress
yeah difficult for me<comma>stress
My parents<comma>nostress
friends I guess<comma> they do give me some pressure especially my mom ((I need)) to study harder<comma>nostress
everything<comma>stress
it is also -- I do not regard it as a pressure<comma>nostress
you know I’m -- I'm self motivated person<comma><comma>nostress
I -- I can manage my pressure pretty -- pretty well I think<comma>nostress
Food that I like is anything which is not offered in ~UST<comma>nostress
uh I w-would recommend Tunisian food of course<comma>nostress
no I do not know how to make it<comma>nostress
My favorite food is Korean food definately<comma>nostress
favorite from the Korean food would be kimchi I know how to make it<comma>nostress
it's quite complicated<comma>nostress
I've never -- never done it without my mum<comma>nostress
no<comma> uh in Hong Kong you can just go to some korean shops or go to the restaurant<comma>nostress
they're not really good here<comma>nostress
i wouldn't really reccomend it<comma>nostress
the work didn't go very well recently<comma>stress
um i've got a lot to do<comma>stress
for some of the tasks i have no idea where to start<comma> um i think i kind of write a -- wrote a paper last month<comma>stress
it's not like a serious paper it's like a student paper contest um i think i didn't have enough time to do that<comma>stress
i'm just kind of finish it up<comma>stress
like not really pay a lot of attention to that<comma>stress
Yeah I've recently seen a new movie<comma> The Expendables<comma>nostress
It's a -- it's an action movie um my favourite type of movies are action movies only<comma>nostress
Ah I get along with other people very well<comma>nostress
compared to high-school ah in here I’m kind of limit -- limited to um like Korean society<comma>nostress
Ah I do not know how<comma>stress
maybe it is<comma>nostress
I have girlfriend<comma>nostress
I always hang out with Korean friends<comma>nostress
Um<comma>stress
I don't know which one is better<comma>nostress
I think both has its you know positive<comma>nostress
negatives<comma>nostress
I do also have many international friends as well<comma>nostress
Um I -- I do have some local friends<comma>nostress
they are like including my old roommates<comma>nostress
they are very kindly<comma>nostress
I’m learning -- I'm actually learning Cantonese from them<comma>nostress
Yeah<comma> I can integrate into Hong Kong society<comma><comma>nostress
I know like I lived in China for seven years<comma>nostress
--<comma>nostress
I also speak Cantonese<comma>nostress
I can understand their culture<comma>nostress
everything better<comma>nostress
Ah my hometown is -- well I still prefer Korea than Hong Kong I guess<comma>nostress
Um yeah I do have many close friends here not a lot<comma>nostress
like really good friend<comma> like five or six<comma>nostress
I think all the electronics courses in ~HKUST are very difficult<comma>nostress
there is lot of workload in them<comma> lot of assignments<comma>stress
stuff<comma>nostress
Work is going okay I guess I don -- I have some deadlines to catch for a few of my courses<comma>nostress
they're not too soon<comma>nostress
I'm not too stressed about it<comma>nostress
I know I get the work done<comma>nostress
um I'll take I guess three years to graduate --<comma>nostress
uh wait -- I have a quiz coming up next month<comma>nostress
no im fine<comma>stress
Well what I do for leisure<comma> uh when I have free time I you know pick up a ball<comma>nostress
do some sports like rugby baskteball whatever<comma>nostress
uh you know I also like um you know playing computer games hanging out with friends that's my leisure time<comma>nostress
right now it's in the library that's my leisure time I've been studying<comma>nostress
um I have -- I saw greys anatomy just yesterday<comma>nostress
house<comma>nostress
big bang theory um I don't like one ~TV show in particular or a movie type in particular anything really does<comma>nostress
After graduating I'd like to get a job<comma> what type of job? no clue<comma> hopefully something -- I have no idea um marketing based maybe<comma>nostress
I'm not looking for a job right now<comma>nostress
I'm year two<comma>nostress
um looking for internships of -- for the summer<comma>nostress
I'd like to do an MBA at one point<comma> maybe two years after having a job<comma>nostress
Yeah my hometown is Delhi<comma>nostress
the -- what I like about Delhi is that uh theres -- it has both cultural aspects as well as the contemporary aspects as well<comma>nostress
I would recommend all uh -- all the people from other countries to come to this place<comma>nostress
it is really beautiful<comma>nostress
uh I would not prefer Hong Kong as my hometown I would just prefer to study over here I would still love to go back to Delhi<comma>nostress
In uh my course since there hasn't been a lot of r- recent work or deadlines or assignments<comma>nostress
my courses are mostly introductory for example introductory uh accounting<comma>nostress
introductory management<comma>nostress
the concepts are all pretty basic<comma>nostress
there hasn't been a lot of uh need to review after classes<comma>nostress
it's -- it's only sort a month into the first semester<comma>nostress
uh --<comma>nostress
there aren't a lot of assignments right now<comma>nostress
there aren't a lot of exams the midterms are still a month away<comma> around uh<comma>nostress
--<comma>nostress
there's nothing else particularly difficult<comma>nostress
what -- the work that I have right now are mostly presentations<comma>nostress
that's what I prefer to uh other writing assignments et cetera<comma>nostress
uh I have -- I have a lot of deadlines to do uh for my ~FYP etcetera also I have a lot of homeworks that I have to do<comma>stress
uh also I have to communicate with uh -- with my ~FYP partner as well<comma>stress
its a bit frustrating sometimes<comma>nostress
of the time difference<comma>stress
I think it would take me another -- about a year uh maybe a bit less to -- to graduate<comma>nostress
um I haven't started any of my uh writing for my ~FYP<comma>stress
um I have started to study for some of my exams<comma>stress
I know its -- all my exams<comma>nostress
mid-terms will be bunched in a group<comma>nostress
I'm not really anxious about anything right now<comma>nostress
for employment I still have another year of university to go<comma>nostress
I don't really tend to think about much -- think much about it<comma>nostress
academic life<comma>nostress
second semester was a lot better than first semester I believe in myself that I can do better uh this semester<comma>nostress
on<comma>nostress
on<comma> uh relationships<comma>nostress
live life are -- they're acceptable they're not too worrysome<comma>nostress
I like Indian food the most<comma>nostress
I would recommend pani puri I do know how to make it<comma>nostress
you can get it in any Indian restaurant<comma>nostress
I'd say overall university<comma>stress
far has been better<comma>nostress
at the end of high school I had really good friends as well<comma>nostress
I think as far as friends go I've been pretty lucky<comma>nostress
enjoying myself<comma>nostress
Well I was born in Hong Kong technically<comma>nostress
I think of Cape town<comma> South Africa as my home town<comma>nostress
specialities in South Africa wud -- that would definately be um wine<comma>nostress
Wine is the big export of South Africa as well as -- w -- we eat alot of meat the -- the -- the stereotype about south african males is that they -- they barbeque a lot of meat although we don't call it barbeque we call it braai<comma>nostress
uh What -- what i would recommend is -- is a holiday in South Africa definately uh anybody whose been to South Africa on -- o -- on holiday really really love it<comma>nostress
--<comma>nostress
they recommend it to everybody else<comma>nostress
Anywhere worth going well I'd say that Cape town is the -- is the heart of tourism in South Africa<comma>nostress
right now I prefer -- I prefer my home town<comma>nostress
whenever --<comma>nostress
you always want what you can't have<comma>nostress
when I'm in South Africa I think about my friends in Hong Kong<comma>nostress
when I'm in Hong Kong I think about home<comma>nostress
my parents are in South Africa<comma>nostress
--<comma>nostress
you always miss going home on the weekend<comma>nostress
Well<comma> I'm anxious about both my academic life<comma>nostress
employment<comma>stress
bor are -- both are interrelated<comma>nostress
I need to have a good academic life -- I mean I should do well in my studies<comma>stress
as well as the extra curricular activities to have a good job<comma>stress
I tried to adapt to the college life by staying around with my friends who are from mainland<comma>nostress
we help each other alot --<comma>nostress
um the reason why I came to this university<comma>nostress
it -- it's business school had very high reputation in Asia<comma>nostress
Hong Kong is a very international<comma>nostress
attractive city for me --<comma>nostress
why ((I)) chose my major study the reason is I like economics<comma>nostress
I like the logic to think in that field<comma>nostress
um I adapt to my college life by making new friends with people around me<comma>nostress
um the reason I choose this university is like<comma>nostress
I like Ho -- I want to come to Hong Kong to see a different culture<comma>nostress
different um studying envionment<comma>nostress
I choose my major<comma>nostress
I'm good at bio-chemistry<comma>nostress
I think this is something that interest me<comma>nostress
My parents just give me the regular pressure you know get good grades<comma>nostress
get a good job afterwards<comma>stress
nothing that really stands out or nothing that's actually detrimen -- detrimental<comma>nostress
I like going on boat trips or sailing or wake boarding for leisure<comma>nostress
I like the ocean<comma>nostress
Um I haven't seen any good movies recently<comma>nostress
tv series I watch quite a few of them ah I only watch the ones that I like<comma>nostress
I guess there are my favourite types of -- the ones I watch are my favourite types<comma>nostress
um My home town would be in India a place called ((rokee)) it's pretty darn small<comma>nostress
there's no reason why anyone would -- would wana go there<comma>nostress
I don't really recommend it um I prefer both they're very different<comma>nostress
I prefer to live in Hong Kong<comma>nostress
uh For lesuire<comma> most of the time I just watch ~TV or I hang around with my girlfriend<comma>nostress
uh The reason being that when I watch ~TV I can be really passive<comma><comma>nostress
then<comma>nostress
uh normally I'm doing a lot of work<comma>nostress
when I'm passive it's uh it's a lot better<comma>nostress
I like spicy food especially chinese spicy food<comma>nostress
I recommend sichuan specialities<comma>nostress
I know there are a lot of Sichuan restaurants in my home town Shenzen -- um I don't know how to make it though<comma>nostress
I'm anxious about my academic life<comma> employment<comma>stress
relationships<comma>stress
empolyment is hard to look for right now relationshps is also hard<comma>stress
academic life is something I can do<comma>stress
I just don't feel like doing right now<comma>nostress
My friends give me pressure when they study in the library<comma>stress
I don't<comma>stress
I feel bad for that<comma>nostress
My parents don't give me that much stress<comma>stress
I don't talk to them that much on the phone<comma>stress
when I do I feel like I -- I should study<comma>nostress
yeah<comma>stress
No man<comma>nostress
I haven't seen any good movies lately<comma>nostress
I've been stuck in the library revising<comma>nostress
That sounds (()) -- sounds pretty boring<comma>stress

uh No my parents -- my parents haven't give me any pressure<comma>stress
uh I think my relatives have<comma>nostress
they -- they've been constantly asking me uh what I'm going to do after my -- uh after graduating<comma>stress
also a little bit from my girlfriend<comma>stress
obviously uh she -- she wants to have a boyfriend that a reliable in the future<comma>stress
The previous holiday I travelled around china quite extensively we -- we went all around China we went to Mongolia<comma> uh ((xing xiao))<comma> uh Beijing<comma> uh lots of places<comma>nostress
after that I went back to South Africa where my parents are<comma>nostress
s --<comma>nostress
I went home for the holidays also -- um What did I like about the place well firstly South Africa is home<comma>nostress
uh<comma>nostress
th -- th -- that in itself says a lot<comma>nostress
what I like about China was that well it's -- it's -- it's there's a sense of familiarity<comma>nostress
I -- I speak chinese<comma>stress
a lot of my relatives are in China<comma>nostress
when -- when I go there it feels more familiar then for example Hong Kong where everybody speaks cantonese<comma>nostress
The types of things that I'm anxious about well right now it's a lack of direction th -- th -- that's my biggest issue right now<comma>nostress
all -- all -- all my life I've been doing what my parents wanted<comma>stress
it's -- it's all turned out well I'm not complaining or anything<comma>nostress
uh it -- it seems like they sort of dictate my life they -- I'm going to do what they want me to do one day<comma>nostress
--<comma>stress
-- it's not like I've been trying to do anything about it either um I haven't really found um -- I haven't really discovered my passion for what I'm going -- for what I want in life<comma>nostress
um to -- the difficulty of -- of finding that passion is what I'm worried about right now<comma>stress
How is my recent work going well to be honest um year two work just started uh summer is over<comma>nostress

mood<comma>stress

I do have deadlines to catch which is my first assignment from uh finance which is next week uh I -- I don't find it that difficult<comma>nostress
I like to self study in the library a lot<comma>nostress
I get the material<comma>nostress
uh when it comes to any difficult problems whatever I'll go straight to the professor be honest with her or what -- what -- what is hard<comma>nostress
hopefully she can help me out<comma>nostress
How -- how long will I take to graduate well this course is -- I'm doing ~BBA<comma>nostress
I'm in year 2<comma>nostress
I have one more year to go<comma>nostress

then --<comma>nostress
then start working<comma>nostress
maybe couple of years of exp -- of work experience in between<comma>nostress
